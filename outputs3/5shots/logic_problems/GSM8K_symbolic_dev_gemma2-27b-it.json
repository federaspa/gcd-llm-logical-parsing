      "question": "A farmer is buying feed for his pigs. He buys a variety of apples, hay, carrots and wheats. Since wheats are a rare treat, he only buys eight 3-kg boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the pigs while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys fourteen 6-kg bags. Apples are the main diet of his pigs, so he buys thirty five 38-kg packs. Hay are a staple to supplement the apples, so he buys seventeen 16-kg sacks. If his farm truck can carry 190 kgs at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?",
