We wrote each variable assignment in standard infix notation:\n   - Normal Brand Flour Cost Per Kilogram: \\( \\text{flour_cost_per_kg} = ¥5 \\)\n   \n3. Then, we formulated the equation to solve using these variables and also in standard infix notation.\n   - Flour Total Cost Calculation Equation: \n     \"Flour_total_cost - (normal_brand_flour_cost_per_kg * days_to_buy_normal_brand)\"\n     \nThis process ensures that all relevant information is captured in a structured form.",

The variables are weights and forces, so the equation to solve becomes an expression involving these values.\n\nThe solution involves multiplying by 100 after dividing by 4% because in infix expressions, we typically use multiplication before division or vice versa when dealing with percentages as coefficients of powers.\nSo, the final answer is:\n((suv_weight + force_to_move) / weight) * (100/force_to_move)\nwhich simplifies to \n(2500 + 4 * (75)) / 100 = 693.48 kilograms per square meter\nNote: The final answer is rounded to the nearest whole number, as SUV weights are typically measured in kilograms.\n\"\"\"",
