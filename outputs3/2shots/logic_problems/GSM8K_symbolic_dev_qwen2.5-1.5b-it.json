So for 380 (total) miles, we use the coverage rate.\n- To find out how many minutes it will take for the entire city to be covered by the fogbank, multiply the total length of the city by the time taken per mile \\( \\frac{city\\_length}{time_to_cover_4_miles} \\).\n- The question asks us to subtract this from 12 (total coverage rate) in minutes.",

This result will be multiplied by 1 (the unit conversion factor).\n- Finally, this new quantity is divided by the total servings in a bag to determine how much of those servings are left for consumption.\nThe resulting equation uses infix notation where each operation follows its operands with the correct precedence and grouping symbols when necessary.",
