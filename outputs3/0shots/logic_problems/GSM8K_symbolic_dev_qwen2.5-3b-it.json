Since her walking rate doubles on the sidewalk compared to the beach:\n  - `(57 / 60) as rate_on_beach`: This converts the 57-minute duration into an hourly fraction.\n- The second data point indicates how much of Kayla’s total time is spent walking on the beach (`19 km`), and she walks at a speed that's twice her pace when she’s walking on the sidewalk. Hence, `(12 = 4.8)` (since `57 / 60 * 2 = 12`). \n- The third data point represents what fraction of the total distance is covered by Kayla during her beach walk (`(19/31) as fraction_of_walk_on_beach`).\n- Finally, we formulate a question that asks for the entire time taken to complete the `31 km` walk in minutes. Since she spends `t_beach = 57 / rate_on_beach`, and `(total_distance - beach_distance)` is walked at half her speed on sidewalk (`(31 - 19) * ((rate_on_beach/2))`) we combine these to get the total time taken: \n```plaintext\nt_total = t_beach + (31-19)*((57 / rate_on_beach)/2)\n```\nThis expression captures everything in infix notation, but does not solve for `total_time`.",

Since it takes 60 minutes to cover the 15-mile stretch at speed `s_beach`, we can express this as \\( s_{beach} = \\frac{15}{t_{rate\\_beach}} = 60 / t_{rate\\_beach} \\).\n- `s_sidewalk` is twice her rate on the beach, so it's expressed as \\( s_{sidewalk} = 2 * (60/t_{rate\\_beach}) = 120 / t_{rate\\_beach} \\).\n- The total distance equation combines the distances covered at each pace: `x` represents the time spent on the beach and `y` represents the time spent walking along the sidewalk, giving us \\( x + y = m \\) or in terms of speed and time \\( s_beach * t_{beach} + s_sidewalk * t_{sidewalk} = 28 \\).\n- Substituting our expressions for speeds gives: \n\\[ (60 / t_{rate\\_beach}) * x + (120 / t_{rate\\_beach}) * y = m. \\]",

The question asks for how many spoons were originally bought by Haruka, but based on available information and provided variables, we formulated equations accordingly:\n- \\( x \\) represents the number of spoons Haruka initially had.\n- Her husband gave her 12 more spoons so she ended up with a total that includes both initial plus additional: \n\\[ y = x + 12. \\]\n- After using some for tasting, and ending up with a total of 26:\n\\[ z - 8 = 26.\\] \nWhere \\(z\\) is the number of spoons Haruka had after her husband's addition.\n\nSo, we deduced that initially she must have bought enough to reach this final count minus what was used for tasting. Hence,\n\\[ z = y + 8 \\]\nAnd since:\n\\[ x + 12 - 8 = 26\\] \nThis translates into the provided equations in standard infix notation.\n```",

Since the problem states their current total is 53 and wants to reach 105 in 3 more weeks (2 per week), it implies we need additional values from them reaching [x] + (3 * y) = 105, with x being what Nadia collects in those three weeks and y representing Aisha's contribution.",

Thus, we have `7900 - 1250 - 400 = x`.\n  \n- **Second Equation:** To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive to give to their friends and family (assuming an equal distribution among all graduates), if there are `y` number of graduates, then the remaining available tickets (`x`) divided by the number of graduates gives us the answer. Hence, we have `x / y = z`.\n\nSo in standard infix notation:\n```json\n\\{\n\"data\": [\n\"7900 - 1250 - 400 = x\",\n\"x / y = z\"\n],\n\"question\": \"x / y = z\"\n}\n```\nThis structure clearly outlines the variable assignments and the equation to solve.",
