The probability of rolling a number greater than 5:\n   On a d10 die (a ten-sided die), there are 4 numbers that satisfy this condition: {6,7,8,9}. There is also the tenth face which can be either '0' or '10', but it does not matter in our problem. Since we're rolling only once and need any one of these four outcomes out of ten possibilities:\n   The probability = 4/10 (or) 2/5.\n\n2. To roll two odd numbers consecutively, first let's find the total number of possible results for each die.\n   There are five odd faces {1,3,5,7,9} on a d10 and we want to have both rolls as one out these outcomes:\n   Probability per event is 5/10 (or) 1/2. \n   When you roll twice consecutively: multiply the probabilities = (1/2)*(1/2).\n\nNow let's calculate actual probability values for better understanding.\n- The first case, rolling a number > 5 has an individual outcome of 4 in every set of ten numbers on that die. Hence it is:\n   Probability(>5) = .40\n\nThe second scenario asks you roll two odd consecutive results from the d10 which gives us:\nProbability(Two Odd Consecutive Rolls)= (1/2)*(1/2).\nHence,\nProbability(odds-odds) 0.25.\n\nNow that we've calculated both, let's calculate how much more likely is it to have first case over second.\nIncreased Likelihood = Probability(>5)-Probability(Odd-Odd)\n= .40 - 0.25 \n= 0.15 \n\nHowever the prompt asked for percentage value of likelihood and not absolute number hence convert increased-likelihood from decimal into percent as follows:\n   Increased-Likelihood Percent\n= (probability > 5) - probability(odds,odds)) *100% = .40-.25*100%= 15%\n\nTherefore: \nAnswer: The final answer is 15.",

The percentage is obtained by multiplying a decimal probability by 100.\n\nProbability greater than 1 = 19/20 ≈ 0.95\nPercentage greater than 1 = Probability greater than 1 × 100% \n= 0.95 * 100%\n≈ 95%\n\nFor rolling two even numbers in a row:\nFirst, calculate the decimal value of probability.\n(10/20) * (10/20)\n= (5/10)*(5/10)  \n= 25/100\nProbability = 1/4 \nPercentage for rolling two even number in a row\n= Probability × 100%\n≈ 0.25* 100% ≈ 25%\n\nTo determine the difference between these percentages:\nDifference percentage \n= Percentage greater than 1 - Percentage of Rolling Two Even Numbers In A Row.\n= 95 % – 25 %\nThe final answer is: The final answer is 70",

Then in the next 24 seconds, 4 times that amount pops: \n   This is calculated as 80 * 4 = 320 kernels popping in the second 24-second interval.\n   \n3. So far we have popped a total of:\n   First 24 seconds + Second 24 seconds\n   Total so far = 80 + 320 = 400\n\n4. In the next 24 seconds, the rate increases to 6 times that amount (of initial popping), \n    This is calculated as: \n      Initial popping in first interval was for every second of 24 seconds.\n      So we can find it out by taking total number popped divided by time taken,\n        i.e.   Rate1 = 80/24=10 kernels/sec\n       New rate will be six times the above:\n           Rate2=6 *Rate1 \n            or, Rate2 =60\n    Total in third interval = Rate2*Time elapsed during that period.\n      As per given time of popping for this case i.e.   24 sec \n         total popped here is :  \n       Total3 = Rate2* Time taken for rate2=  60 *24 \n        or,Total3:1440.\n\n    So far we have popped a new total (previous+new):\n     Newtotal sofar =400 +1440\n      i.e.   Newtotalssofar now becomes :1840\n\n5. Then in the final 24 seconds of cooking:\n       it is given that \"half rate\" pops.\n          half rate means, as kernel was popping at six times the previous \n           (as seen during step four above), so we are going to make this\n            newrate for next interval by using same procedure used while determining Rate2 in fourth point above.        \n         Now lets find it out first of all how many kernels popped per second now that is \"sixth rate\". Sixth rate =1440/24=60.\n           As given, its half pops i.e., 30 here and for time elapsed of another next interval i.e., again equal to twenty-four seconds. \n    Thus the total kernel popping during this period is calculated as follows:\n   Total popped in fourth interval : Rate3*Time taken =Total4\n      where we have:Rate3=half sixth rate = sixty kernels per sec/2.\n       and, time elapsed for above period was 24seconds i.e.,time elapsed= twentyfour seconds here.        \n           So ,total4 =(sixty / two)*twenty-four \n         Total kernel popped in fourth interval is :Total4=720.\n\n    The new total becomes: previous + New\n     or it now equals to, (Previous)1840+New 720.\n        thus we get the answer for above question by simply adding them together.        \n       so this finally results as follows:\n            Final kernel popped uptil fourth interval = Total of all intervals= Previous plus newtotal here.\n             This is nothing but: previous total + last popped i.e.,1840+720, \n         giving us 2560.\n\n6. After Mateo takes the skillet off heat,\n     \"A quarter\" more kernels pop due to residual heat as compared with above popping in final interval which was of twentyfour seconds here.\n          To be simple we are going to calculate it by simply multiplying (total popped during fourth and last period) that is, 2560*1/4 =quarter of the number of total kernel popped uptill now. But wait this has been asked for a different thing i.e.,for popping in final interval here not up-to four intervals as was calculated above. Thus lets go back to previous step where we have got: Total popped during fourth and last period which is equal to 720. \n     So it should be multiplied by (1/4) rather than, multiplying totaluptilnow with same quarter i.e.,2560.\n    so the answer here becomes as follows:\n   Thus now our final value of a kernel that pops after removing heat from skillet will become,\n        This is nothing but 720*onefourth=180.\n\n7. Final number popped would thus be sum of \"popped uptillnow\" plus newly added extra kernels \n      which were not included in above count because it has been given,that this popping was done due to the residual heat as skillet removed from flame.\n    Thus now final total kernel becomes: previous + new\n     or Totaluptonow=2560+180\n   giving us a value of 2740.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 2740.",

So far, we have a total of 10 + 30 = 40 popped kernels after 28 seconds.\n\n4. In the next 14 seconds, 4 times the initial popping rate occurs, which means 4 * 10 = 40 more kernels pop in this time frame (not 4 times the previous amount).\n\n5. So far, we have a total of 40 + 40 = 80 popped kernels after 42 seconds.\n\n6. In the final 14 seconds, half of the rate as the past 14 seconds occurs. Since there were 40 pops in that time frame and it's now reduced by half, this gives us (1/2) * 40 = 20 more kernel pops in these last 14 seconds.\n\n7. So far, we have a total of 80 + 20 = 100 popped kernels after the pot has been removed from heat.\n\n8. A quarter of those that popped during the final time period also pop now due to residual heat (which was 1/4 * 20), adding another 5 kernel pops.\n\n9.

This means he will have 1 set of harvested plums after the first month (which is not possible), then another at two months etc until twelve.\nThis therefore makes it easy for us to calculate how many times this number multiplies by as plum_total * 1 = plum_total \nWhich would make our total amount equal\nharvest_plum_per_year = plum_total * harvest_time_in_a_year\n= plum_total * (12/12) months/year \nHowever, we can simply just multiply plum_total * 1 or in this case, leave the answer as it is.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 1305",

Since she has 10 potted plants on each ledge and there are 55 ledges in total:\nTotal existing plants = Number of plants per ledge * Total number of ledges\n= 10 * 55 \n= 550\n\nGabrielle received 44 new potted plants two days ago, so we need to add those as well. Now her total is:\nNew total = Existing plants + New plants\n= 550 + 44\n= 594 \n\nThe next day (tomorrow), Gabrielle will give away some of the plants from each window ledge - a total of 7 per ledge across all ledges.\nTotal given-away plants = Number of plants to be given away * Total number of ledges \n= 7 * 55  \n= 385  \n\nFinally, let's calculate how many potted plants Gabrielle will remain with by subtracting the ones she gave away from her new total. Now we have:\nRemaining Plants = New total - Given-away plants\n= 594 - 385\n= 209\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 209",

Let x be the number of cupcake boxes he sold on Tuesday.\n   Then (x + 14) is the number of cups he sold on Wednesday.\n\n2. Since we know that he sold a total of 25 boxes of cupcake on Tuesday, then:\n    x = 25\n\n3. On Wednesday James also sold (x+14), which means: \n     (25 + 14)\n   So,\n      He sold 39 cups in Wednesday \n\n4. Now let's determine how many watermelon pie he sold each day.\n   We know that on Tuesday, the number of boxes is fewer by 15 than those from wednesday\n   And we also know he has sold a total of 21 box pies on Wednesdays.\n\n5. Let y be the number of boxes he sells in tuesday:\n    On Wednesday it will become: \n       (y+15)\n    \n6. Since we already knew that James had only been selling as much as 21 pie in wednesday\n   Then, to find how many watermelon pies were sold on Tuesday:\n     We use the following equation:\n\n         y + 15 = 21 \n\n7.

Thus,\n- The speed at which Mia walks on a sidewalk will be double of what it was for beaches: \nSidewalk's Speed = 2 * Beach's Speed\nSidewalk's Speed = 0.4 kilometers/minute\n\nNow, let's use the calculated speeds to find how long does she need in order walk her favorite trail that is at least (or equal) to sidewalk which takes 12 Kilometers.\nTime on Sidewalks for walking a distance of 12 km \n= Distance / speed = 12 kilometer/0.4 kilometers per minute\n= 30 minutes\n\nSo far we now know how long it took Mia in order complete her walks that she made along both beach as well sidewalk.\n\nFinally, let's add up the time to get our final answer.\nTime taken for entire walk \n= Time spent walking on beach + Time Spent Walking On Sidewalk\nTotal = 60 minutes (on beaches) + 30 minutes(on sidewalks)\nThe total of these times are equal to: Total = 90 minutes \n\nAnswer: The final answer is 90.",

Let x be Zahra's rate of speed in miles per hour (mph) when she is walking on the beach.\n2. Since it takes 60 minutes for her to walk 15 miles on the beach, we can set up a proportion using distance = rate * time and solve for x:\n\n   Distance = Rate * Time\n   15 miles = x mph * 1 hour (since there are 60 minutes in an hour)\n   \n3. Since it takes Zahra 60 minutes to walk the first part of her journey, we convert this into hours:\n    60 min / 60 min/hour is equal to one hour\n   \n4. However that isn't right so let's try again: \n   We know she walks for an hour (the beach portion) and travels at x miles per hour.\n   \n5. That means the following equation can be derived from distance equals rate times time\n    15 = X * 1\n   \n6. This results in Zahra walking on the sand with a speed of: \n   Speed is therefore equal to X which must then mean she walks this part at fifteen miles per hour.\n\n7.

Thirty miles per hour means she walks really fast when not in the sand\n\n9. If fifteen miles at Fifteen mph can take sixty min, what does that mean?\n    We must now find her time on sidewalks - for this we do it by first taking our total sidewalk distance: \n   30 (total) minus fifteen =fifteen\n10. That leaves us with the final problem to solve Zahra's walk at thirty miles per hour is how long?\n\n11. The solution becomes apparent and now can be solved in one easy formula:\n    Fifteen / Thirty means it would take half an hour for her sidewalk, or 30 min.\n\n12. Now we know she spends sixty on sand plus the additional time spent walking sidewalks of: \n   thirty minutes\n13.

We are also told that she walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach when she is walking on the sidewalk.\n\n3. Amelia spends 44 minutes walking on the beach, so we can calculate her rate of speed while walking on the beach:\n   - Let's use 'b' as the time it takes to walk one kilometer on the beach.\n   - We know that distance equals rate times time (d = rt). Rearranging this formula gives us: r = d / t\n   - On the beach, Amelia walks 11 kilometers in 44 minutes. First convert her speed into a 'kilometers per minute' by dividing both sides of the equation to give you 'rate':\n     Rate equals distance divided by time (d/t) or:\n       rate on the beach is: r = d / t\n       rate on the beach is: r = 11km/44min, \n                             r=0.25 kilometers per minute.\n\n4. Since we know Amelia's speed walking on the sidewalk is two times her speed while she walks along the beach then:\n   - Rate of speed equals (2 * .25 km/min), or\n     rate of speed at which she can walk 1 kilometer on a side-walk =0.5 kilometers per minute.\n\n5. To find how long it takes for Amelia to complete walking all her sidewalk, use time=distance/rate and multiply that by the given distance walked: \n   - t equals d over r (time), or\n     Time spent on a 13km walk would be:\n       time=(d *r): t = 13/0.5,\n           which is equal to 26 minutes.\n\n6. We now have two of our values for the total walking times: \n    - The beach takes Amelia 44 min.\n    - Walking sidewalk took her another 26 min.\n7.

Since she walks 15 miles in 60 minutes (which equals one hour) on the beach, her speed can be calculated using the formula: \n   Speed = Distance / Time\n   However we need to convert time from minute into hours.\n   \n3. We calculate Kimia's walking speed by converting first time in term of hours then plug it as follows:\n   60 minutes is equal one hour hence x miles per hour equals distance divide by an hour, therefore: \n    Speed on beach = Distance / Time\n                     = 15/1 (since the given minute are converted to hour)\n                     \n\n4. It's stated that she walks two times faster than her speed on the sidewalk so we can assume it will be twice as much of x miles per hours.\n   Let Kimia walking rate for side walk is:\n    Speed at Sidewalk = 2x \n\n5. Given total distance covered by kimia are: \n   Total Distance     = Beach + SideWalk\n                       =15      +19\n                        =34\n\n6. And the time taken to complete this entire journey can be calculated using formula as below, which will have two components one for beach and other sidewalk.\n    Time at each part  =Distance / Speed \n\n7. Now let us plug value of distance covered on both parts:\n   We know that speed is x miles per hour hence \n     time taken to complete the Beach walk= Distance/Speed\n =(15miles) / (x mile/hour)\n   Similarly we have another equation for sidewalk as follows:  \n    Time at Sidewalk =Distance / Speed \n\n8. Plug value of distance covered on both parts:\n  We know that speed is x miles per hour hence \n     time taken to complete the side walk= Distance/Speed\n =(19miles) /(2*x mile/hour)\n\n9. Simplify each equations from step (7 and 8):\n   Time at Beach =15/x hours or (15/x)*60 minutes since we have converted it into minute.\n   Similarly \n     time taken to complete the side walk= Distance/Speed\n =(19miles) /(2*x mile/hour)\n    Hence sidewalk will be having equation: \n      Sidewalk in hour  = 9.5 / x hours or (9.5/x)*60 minutes since we have converted it into minute.\n\n10. From above equations, combine total time to complete the walk of beach and side-walk by kimia are as follows:\n    Total Time       =(15*60)/(x) + ((19/2)*(1)) * 60 / ( x )\n\n11. The information given in this problem can be used for further calculation: \n     It is already given that she walks on the beach, which equals one hour hence time taken to complete her journey at beach will have equation as below:\n      Time = Distance/ Speed\n          =(15 mile) /(x miles/hour)\n   But from statement (3), we know x= 15miles per hour. So plug this in both part of the equations that is for Beach and sidewalk:  \n    The total time taken by kimia to complete her walk can be calculated using formula:\n      Time at beach =( Distance/ Speed ) *60 minutes \n                    =   (1)hour* 60min/hr\n                     = 60 min.\n     Similarly we have another equation for sidewalk as follows:\n       Total time on Sidewalk=(19miles)/(2*(15 miles/hour))\n                           =(0.633333 hour)*60 minute/hrs\n\n12. Calculate the value of above equations: \n    Time at beach      =   (1)hour* 60min/hr\n                         = 60 min.\n     Similarly we have another equation for sidewalk as follows:\n       Total time on Sidewalk=(19miles)/(2*(15 miles/hour))\n                           =(0.633333 hour)*60 minute/hrs \n                           =38 minutes\n\n13. Sum up the values of both Beach and side-walk to get final answer in terms of minutes\n    Time at beach      =  60 min.\n     Similarly we have another equation for sidewalk as follows:\n       Total time on Sidewalk=   (19miles)/(2*(15 miles/hour))\n                           =(0.633333 hour)*60 minute/hrs \n                            =38 minutes\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 98",

If 44 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 29-mile walk, in minutes?",

    "logic_problem": {
      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\nLet's break this problem down into smaller steps.\n\nFirst, let's find Kimia's speed on the beach. We know she spends 44 minutes walking on the beach and covers a distance of 11 miles.\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\nTime is given in minutes, so we'll convert it to hours for simplicity (1 hour = 60 minutes).\nTime spent on the beach in hours = 44/60\n\nHowever, since our answer needs to be in minutes, let's keep time in minutes and calculate speed as miles per minute.\n\nSpeed on the beach = Distance / Time\n= 11 miles / 44 minutes\n= 1/4 mile per minute (simplified for explanation purposes)\n\nNow we know Kimia walks at a certain rate on the beach. On the sidewalk, she walks twice that fast.\nSo her speed on the sidewalk is:\nSpeed on the sidewalk = 2 * Speed on the beach \nSince we're trying to solve this in minutes and our initial 'speed' was an explanation let's simplify from here using ratios for time.\n\nTime spent walking on the sidewalk can be represented by a variable, say \"x\". Given that she walks at twice her rate of speed it would take half as long.\nTherefore: \nSidewalk distance / (1/2 * beach time) = 18 miles / x\n11 miles / 44 minutes = 18 miles / (22 minutes), because the sidewalk walking is done in less than half the total, meaning we can approximate this and use a direct relationship. Given that rate of speed doubles for sidewalks then time would be halved.\n\nNow calculate \"x\", which represents how long it takes to walk on the sidewalk.\nGiven our explanation: \n11 miles / 44 minutes = 18 miles / x\nWe have stated previously in terms of half, so let's state as a ratio:\nSidewalk walking rate is double that of beach then time would be halved. Beach was given at \"x\" being for sidewalks we are using the term to equate ratios: \n22 * (11/18) = 13.22 minutes rounded up from our equations and previous logic, however since she walks twice as fast it's indeed half her total walk on beach which is stated previously so x= 44 /2\nSo now let's find \"x\":\nSidewalk walking time is given by the rate of speed being doubled therefore: \nTime = Beach Time/ (Rate * Rate), here we will state in equation form as:\nBeach Walk Time/(1*rate) - that would be normal walk however it was 2 times so\n= x, which equals to beachtime / 2 \n\nx = 44 minutes / 2 \nSince given statement about walking speed ratio and time spent then indeed the sidewalk is half her total \"beach\" amount of walking. Simplifying this:  \nSidewalk Time Spent Walking (given as variable 'x') x=22.\nBeach walk was stated previously so if we add both together to get our final answer:\nTotal Walk = 44 + Sidewalk time \nTotal Walk = Total Beach Walking Time plus sidewalk - or just the sum of beachtime and sidewalk walking since they are equal in length (given that speed rate doubled).\nNow using values, with 'x' now given as a variable for explanation purposes we can find:  \nSidewalk total walk was half her amount so adding together \nTotal Walk = 44 +22\n=66\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 66",

Then, her speed on the sidewalk will be 3 times that rate: '3x'.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Tara's time spent walking on each surface in terms of distance and then apply this to find a value for x.\n\nThe total walking time is given by:\nTime = Total Distance / Speed\n\nFor beach walk: \nDistance = 11 kilometers\nSpeed = x km/min (unknown)\nGiven Time = 66 minutes \n\nEquating these we can now get the unknown speed rate on the beach. Using, distance/speed formula rearranged to solve for 'x' gives us:\nTime * Speed = Distance -> Rearranging this equation yields: \n66 min * x = 11km\nDivide both sides of equation by 66 and multiply it with (60/1) as conversion factor since there are sixty minutes in one hour. Since speed is needed per minute.\nx km/min= 11 / 66\n\nNow solving for Tara's walking rate on the beach:\nDistance/Time = Speed \nSpeed x = Distance/ Time \nThe given distance of 11 and time spent at this surface:  \n11 kilometers / (60 * 1) minutes to get a numerical value for speed 'x'. However we know that in total she walked it in sixty six minute thus\n(66 min) x= 11 km -> solve above formula and you find \nx =0.16667 \n\nThe beach walking rate is then used as base reference so multiply by three times this, her sidewalk's actual value:\n3 * (speed 'x') on the beach which equals to: \nsidewalk speed y =3 x \ny= 0.5 kilometers per minute\n\n\nNow that we have Tara's speeds for both surfaces, calculate total walking time using a distance/speed formula.\nTotal Walking Time is given by adding her surface specific times together:\nTime spent at sidewalk in minutes = Distance/Speed\nGiven: Sidewalk speed y and the sidewalk walk of 14 kilometer then \nSidewalk Speed * Sidewalk Walk Duration= 14km (thus)\ny km/min x t min = 14, where 't' is time taken for this.\nNow that we know her walking rate on sidewalks already thus \n(0.5) y* t=14 -> solve the equation you get sidewalk walk duration as:  \nSidewalk Walk Duration in minute:\nTime spent at Sidewalk (y)= Distance / Speed\nSpeed * Time = 14 km\nDividing both sides of this by speed, then solving for 't':\nt min=(Distance/speed) \n= 14/0.5\n\n28 minutes \n\nThus sidewalk walking time is twenty eight mins.\n\n\nThe total walk duration equals the sum of her beach and sidewalk times.\nTara's Total Walking Time = Beach Walk Duration + Sidewalk Walk Duration\nNow that we know both surface specific durations in minute:\nTotal walking time= 66+ 28 \nminutes\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 94",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find Rania's walking speed on the beach and then use it to calculate her total time spent walking. \n\nLet's start with what we know:\n- Total distance = 30 km\n- Distance walked on the beach = 12 km\n- Distance walked on the sidewalk = 18 km\n\nTime taken for walking on the beach is given as 48 minutes.\n\nSince speed = distance / time, let Rania's walking speed on the beach be 'x' kilometers per minute (km/min). Therefore:\nSpeed of Rania on the sidewalk will be three times this rate: 3 * x km/min. \n\nTime taken to walk a certain distance can also be expressed as Time = Distance/ Speed.\n\nSo we know time spent walking on the beach, and it is given in minutes which means our speed should be calculated per minute.\nFirst let's find Rania's speed 'x' while she walks on the beach:\nWe have 48 min of her walk spent on a distance that equals to: \nDistance walked on the beach = Speed * Time\n12 km= x * (48/60)h, convert minutes in hours so we can get speed per hour.\n\nLet's simplify it by converting all units into either seconds or just staying with given information. Given time is already provided as 48 min which also means that distance walked on the beach:\nSpeed 'x' equals to: \n12 km= x * (48)min, then let us express this equation in kilometers per minute.\nTherefore we can re-write it using speed unit = kilometer/minute.\n\nLet's simplify and find Rania's walking rate while she is at the beach\nWe have 48 minutes so now our formula changes as follows:\n12 km / x * (60) min/hour= (48/60h). \nSimplify this equation to be: x = speed of person equals distance/time. Therefore we can re-write it in form:\nx= Distance walked on the beach / Time taken.\nThis simplifies into\nDistance 12km is equal walking rate 'x' * time spent which is given as 48 minutes.\n\nLet's convert all this information and express our formula using same units so if x will be speed per minute then \n12 km equals to: Speed (per min) multiplied by the number of minutes.\nTherefore now we can simplify it into equation form:\nSpeed= distance / Time taken\nx = Distance walked on beach/ 48min \nWe have time given already in required unit which is equal to x. Thus our formula should be modified as follows.\n\nTo find speed, plug values for 'Distance' and 'Time':\n12 km equals walking rate * 48 min.\nSpeed equals distance/time or let's say we can also express this equation using simple math expression such that \nx = Distance walked on the beach / time taken. Since given time is already in required unit (which means minute).\nSimplify into:\n x= 12km/ 48min\n\nCalculate Rania's walking rate while she walks at the beach.\nDivide both sides by 48 min and plug numbers to find out what will be her speed\nx = Distance walked on the beach / time taken for this distance, so \nx= (12 km)/(48) minute. \n\nNow simplify it: x equals:\n0.25km/min\n\nSince we know she walks three times faster at sidewalk let's calculate how fast does Rania walk when walking 18 kilometers of a sidewalk.\n3 * speed 'x' = her rate on the sidewalk\nTherefore, multiply our result by factor which will be equal to \nsidewalk walking rate= (0.25*60 min/hour)km/min x(3)\nIt's given as: she walks at three times faster rate than beach and thus we have value for speed now:\nWe can also simplify this expression in a simple multiplication form.\nSidewalk walking rate equals to \n0.75 km /min\n\n\nNow that Rania's rates are known, calculate her time spent on the sidewalk using given formula\nTime = Distance/Speed.\n\nDistance walked at the sidewalk= 18km and we know speed now as well (as calculated above), which is equal to:\nspeed 's' equals \n0.75 km/min\n\nTherefore let us simplify this expression in equation form.\nWe have time spent on beach already, but what about total walking time?\nLet's find out how long it takes her for Rania to complete sidewalk distance\nTime taken = Distance/ Speed or simply we can also express as follows:\nSidewalk walk duration equals: \nDistance walked at the sidewalk/speed (on this sidewalk).\nThus our equation becomes now into simple expression, which is given below:\n\nWe have numbers so let's plug in values and find out what will be time spent to complete her 18 km distance on a sidewalk.

Convert all time to hours for easier calculation.\n   - 45 minutes = 0.75 hour (since there are 60 minutes in an hour)\n   - 30 minutes = 0.5 hour\n   - Tuesday and Wednesday, he watched a total of 2 * 5-hour episodes = 10 hours\n\n2. On Friday, Luis watched one 5-hour episode and one 30-minute show.\n   - Total time on Friday is: 5 + 0.5 = 5.5 hours.\n\n3. On Saturday, he got to stay up late and watched two 2-hour episodes:\n   - Two 2-hour episodes equal a total of 4 hours.\n\n4. Now we can calculate the amount of TV Luis has watched so far (excluding Thursday):\n   - Total time on Tuesday and Wednesday: 10\n   - Plus Friday's viewing time: 10 + 5.5 = 15.5\n   - Plus Saturday's viewing time: 15.5 + 4 = 19.5 hours\n\n5.

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \n\n1. First, let's convert all the time Qasim watched TV to hours.\n   On Thursday and Friday, he watched 4-hour episodes each night for a total of (2 * 4) = 8 hours.\n\n2. On Sunday, we have one episode that is 3-hours long and another that was 45 minutes which equals .75 hours when converted from minutes to hours. So the time spent on TV watching these two shows totals at 3 + .75 = 3.75 hours.\n \n3. Monday he watched five episodes of a show, each lasting three hours for an additional total viewing time of (5 * 3) = 15 hours.\n\n4. Total amount of hours from Thursday through Friday and Sunday to Monday is calculated by adding the results we have gotten so far which equals: 8 + 3.75 + 15 = 26.75\n\n5. Now that we know Qasim watched TV for a total time period equaling 28, when he spent watching episodes during Saturday's evening remains as (28 - 26.75) or just simply put in equation format equals: x=1.25 hours.\n\n6. As it is given to us the duration of each episode was only fifteen minutes long which also means we are required here today so that this calculation converts time into how many episodes watched at night from Saturday can be made easily by converting 15 min to just one hour (60min = 4 times more). \n\n7. We now find out Qasim has spent an equivalent of four .25 or a quarter which is basically also same as saying he was watching for: (1.25 /0.25) hours\n\n8. It converts the time into number of episodes watched by him during evening on Saturday.\n\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 10",

This is done by adding up all the wool required for a single set (sweater + vest + cardigan + socks + booties). Then multiply this value with 5 since she has quintuplets.\n\nSo let's break it down further: \n- The sweater requires 16 skeins\n- A vest needs 3 skein of yarn\n- Cardigans need 17 skeins.\n- Each pair of sock will use up about five.  \n- For each set of booties eight are used \n\nFor one child we'll have to add those values (16+3 +17 +5+8). We can simplify that calculation by performing it in the order presented above: \n( 16 + 3) =19, then\n( 19 + 17)=36 and finally,\nadd five for socks: ( 36 + 5 )=41. Add eight to complete this particular set of garments for one child which equals fifty - we get that from adding the previous value forty-one plus nine or \n50 by doing math using numbers as follows : \n(41+8) =49 \n\nTo account for all five kids multiply our total yarn requirement (in terms skeins used up per single person i.e. 49 ) times number of children which is, in this case quintuplets meaning that Jasmine has to do this entire operation exactly FIVE TIMES.\n\nTherefore the final answer will be:\nAnswer: The final answer is 245",

Given that there's a new admission of patients (25 each day) for two weeks, we must calculate the total number of admissions in those two weeks.\n   Since one week has seven days and they admitted patients over two weeks:\n   Total Days Admitting Patients = Number Of Weeks * Days Per Week\n   Total Days Admitting Patients = 2 * 7 \n   Total Days Admitting Patients = 14\n\n4. Now let's find out the total number of new admissions.\n    Since there are daily admissions (25 patients a day) over two weeks:\n    New Occupied Rooms Due To Disaster Over Two Weeks = Daily Admission Rate Per Day * Number Of Patient-Admission Days\n    New Occupied Rooms Due To Disaster Over Two Weeks = 25 Patients/day * Total Days Admitting Patients \n    New Occupied Rooms Due To Disaster Over Two Weeks = 25 patients per day *14 days   \n   New Occupied Rooms Due To Disaster Over Two Weeks = 350 \n\n5. Given that there are new occupied rooms (from the disaster), we should subtract them from unoccupied to calculate remaining vacant beds:\n     Total Unoccupied After Admission = Unoccupied Before The Admissions - Newly Occupied During These Admittances\n    Since New admissions filled up some of those available vacancies.\n   Total Unoccupied Rooms Remaining  In Clinic: \nTotal Unoccupied After Admission = (Unoccupied Rooms) Before Disaster – New occupied rooms over two weeks\n   Total unoccupied after admission = 375-350  \nAnswer: The final answer is 25",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \n\nFirst, we know Oscar's current age is 17 years old. \nIn the future (6 years later), Sakura will be four times as old as Oscar currently is.\nThat means in six years from now Sakura would have an age of 4 x 17 = 68.\n\nSince that represents her age after a period of time, we subtract those same number of years to find out what it was before - thus finding the current year's value. So we take away six as this amount is for the future.\nSakura will be four times Oscar's present age (six years from now), so she would have been 68 minus 6 in her previous or past age, and that equals to: \n68 - 6 = 62.\n\nSince Sakura was actually younger by about six at some point before this moment of time. The problem asked for the current year value.\nWe therefore need a further subtraction which also represents an additional period back into the past (six years in total). That is, we have 62 minus another set of those same extra years:\n \n62 - 6 = 56.\n\nThat was Sakura's age six more years before this particular time frame. But what if she actually had fewer or even no 'those extra' additional years? There are other possible different ages for her in that case (fewer by the value corresponding to that exact number of those same \"additional\" years, which here is 6).\nThat would also be subtracted from this age - six. Now Sakura's current year has actually only one fewer 'those extra' additional set(s), so it should have just a single subtraction operation for these particular values:\n56 (minus) one more and last time of those same value (six): \nis 50.\nHowever we are not done yet, because the task is to determine Sakura's age at this moment in time - which has fewer by another additional six. As stated above, that means a further subtraction operation would be applied once again for these very values.\n\nSo what was it then? That last value from where we subtracted one more 'those extra' (six), and thus getting 50.\nNow the same Sakura's age in current year should also have fewer by another set of six - which is yet to find. It can be found via an additional subtraction for that single remaining number, as follows: \nSakura would then therefore now have this value minus one last 'those extra' (six), and so it equals 50 - those very same numbers:\nSo the correct answer we are seeking here will thus also need a further operation of subtracting six. Therefore Sakura's current age can be found with that final calculation as follows: \nSakura is currently then this value, minus one last set or number (six) = 44.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 11",

The registration fee is 4% of $980000 and so is the agent's fee.\n2. Registration fee = (4/100) x $980000 = $39200\n3. Agent fee = (4/100) x $980000 = $39200\n4. Total fees paid by Prof. Miller for registration and agents' commission are: \n   Total Fees = ($39200 + $39200) =  $78400.\n5. In addition to the above mentioned total fees, he also had a remaining loan amount of $310000 which needs to be subtracted from selling price as well.\n6. To determine Prof Miller's net proceeds we need to calculate:\n   Net Proceeds = Selling Price - Total Fees Paid for Registration and Agent Commission - Remaining Loan Amount\n7. Substituting values in the equation: \n    Net Proceeds  = ($980000) - $78400 - ($310000)\n8. Doing simple math operations gives us, Net proceeds from selling his apartment is:\n   Net Proceeds = ($980000-$310000)-$78400 \n\nAnswer: The final answer is 591600",

This is done by dividing total number of available pieces of lasagnas (36) with daily consumption rate which was found out above. \nSo we get the following result:\nDays = Total portions / Portions per day\n= 36/12\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 3",

Convert 9 days into hours for cleaner availability: Since there are 10 working hours in a given workday, then we get 10 hrs/day x 9 days to equal 90hrs.\n3. Converting the total available time from 'hours' to 'minutes': The conversion gives us (60 minutes / hr * 90hr) = 5400min\n4. Calculate average daily cleaning in minutes: Since there are only so many hours they can be on a given workday, we have that each day has about an equal number of minutes dedicated towards it from the cleaner's available time.\n   Total required time to clean all floors is (2700 min), and total time for 9 days = 5400min\n5. Calculate average daily cleaning in hours: The calculation gives us a value as follows, since each day has about an equal number of minutes dedicated towards it from the cleaner's available time.\n   Average daily required time to clean all floors is (2700 min / 90) ≈ 30min per floor * 10floors =300\n6.

To get a quarter off on each one of these five pounds, we'll find out how much that discount saves her.\n   A 'quarter' in this case means 25%, or (1/4) - she will pay only three-quarters for the discounted ones:\n   \n   The original price per pound is ₺20. \n   So a quarter off would be: ₺5 * 0.75 = ₺3.75\n   \n   For five pounds at this discount, her cost goes down by ₺18.75.\n   \n4. Calculate how much she paid for the saltwater taffy after applying that discount:\n   The original total price was ₺460 - subtracting a total of: \n   ₺20 * 5 = ₺100 and then adding back in what those five cost with discounts applied, which is\n   (₺20-₺3.75)*5= ₺81.25.\n   \n   So that becomes:\n   Original price minus original discount plus the new prices of these items \n   ₺460 - ₺18.75 = ₺441.25\n   \n   She also bought a mixed bag for:  ₺11.50\n   And she got keychains costing her ₺20.75 each and fourteen in number.\n   \n5.

Determine the length available for each set (flower + space):\n   Each set will consist of a flower that grows 4 feet wide, plus an empty space between every plant which is 16.75 feet long.\n   \n2. Calculate total length per one flower and its following gap:\n   The total length required per set = width of the flower + empty space \n = 4 ft + 16.75 ft\n = 20.75 ft.\n\n3. Find how many sets (flower+gap) can be accommodated in a bed that's 201 feet long.\n   \n   To avoid fractional plant placement, let’s subtract one set length and then calculate total possible number of flowers:\n     Total Sets Accommodating Space Length\n       = Available Flower Bed space / flower plus empty gap \n         - One last space without next plant is removed for calculation simplicity so we use (n * 20.75) +4 <201.\n        n ≈ floor((197)/20.75).\n           where 'floor' denotes rounding down to nearest integer, since a partial set of flower+empty space isn't possible.\n\n   Plugging in numbers and solving: \n    Total Sets Accommodating Space Length\n       = ( 197 ) / 20.75 ft.\n         ≈ floor(9.49)\n            which gives n= 9 as only whole number\n\n4.

      "raw": "\n\nTo find out how much money Kimia will spend at the store, we first need to determine how many plants she needs in total and then subtract the ones she already owns. \n\nStep by step reasoning:\n1. Calculate available space for flowers: \nKimia has a flower bed that is 144 feet long.\nEach plant takes up (7 + 12) = 19 feet of space.\n\n2. Determine number of plants required to fill entire length:\nAvailable_length = Total_length / Plant_occupation_space\nAvailable_length = 144 / 19 ≈ 7.5789, we will consider the floor value for available slots as you cannot plant a fraction.\nHence Available_slots = 7 (You can only have whole flower beds so this is rounded down from 7.5789)\n\n3. Since she already owns some plants and Kimia needs to buy more flowers:\nNumber_of_plants_required_to_buy = Total_Available_Slots - Number_of_flowers_already_owned \n= 7 - (-10 doesn't work here, as you can only have positive number of flower slots that is available for planting) since total length will be divided into smaller sections with space left over.\n\nSo Available_slots should actually be calculated taking in consideration we are working on discrete units.\nIf a slot has at least the required 19 feet then it counts towards possible locations:\nAvailable_length = Total_length / Plant_occupation_space \n= (7 + 12) * x <=144\nWe solve for 'x' to find how many whole sections there will be. Thus we can divide into: \n(7+12)x = 144 -> (19x)=144, then dividing both sides by 19:\nAvailable_slots_x ≈ 144/19≈ 7.5789\n\nHowever you would actually round down only if this were a continuous number line with infinite divisions for space - instead we work within discrete units or 'slots'.\nWith given dimensions of plants and spacing (for example, the length taken up per plant: \nSince there will be remainder after 144 /19 , lets try to see how many whole sections would actually fit.\nThe answer is found using algebra:\nSection_number = total_length / Plant_length_and_space\n= x * (Plant_width + space) <= Total_flowerbed_length  \nx*(7+12)= x*19<=144 \nThus we find that a max of 7.5789 -> thus the number will be rounded down for 'maximum' slots, since you can't use partial flower or plant sections.\n\nTo correctly solve this problem: lets do it by testing possible values in multiples.\nOne method is to first divide into whole numbers as done above:\n(144/19) gives us an answer of 7.5789\nIf there are remainder lengths from (144 /19) that still allow the planting with required spacing then we can have more than just these discrete units or 'slots'\nNow lets check if it is possible to plant one additional flower at end.\nLet's calculate length taken up for all whole sections - since each section has a 7 feet wide and also requires space of (12) so let total_length_section = width+space\nTotal_length_of_seven_plants= x *19 \n= 7*(7 +12)\nNow lets find how much more room will be available at the end.\nRemainder_lengths= Total_flowerbed - length_used_by_7_sections \nIf remainder is greater than required plant space then we have enough for another flower.\n\nTotal_length_section = (7+12) *x\nLet x equal 7: so now lets find out how much total room will be taken up:\n(19*7)=133 feet. Total_flowerbed - length_used_by_7_sections \n144-133=11, since remainder is less than required plant space of 19 we can't have another flower.\n\nThus number_of_plants_required_to_fill_flowers = available_slots_x\nSince it was shown above that a max of only 'seven' whole sections would be possible - thus if she already has ten flowers then no additional money will need to spent.",

Here\n(162)/(16.75) so approximately '9' more.\nSince she already has some, we just need to calculate how many are actually required by subtracting existing ones from that number:\nNewly bought flowering plant = Total flowers Olivia will have – Existing flowers \n= (10+1)-11 or simply put 9\n\nCost of each new flower is ₺5. So the total money spent on buying new plants would be\n₺5 * Number of newly purchased flowers.\nThe answer in terms of how much she needs to buy = '9'.\n\nStep by step reasoning: \nNew flowering plant bought at store= Total Olivia will have - existing ones i.e 10-11 or simply put just total without considering first one so, the new plants needed are calculated using (165-3)/16.75 as per our logic above.\n\n\n\nAnswer: The final answer is ₺45",

Determine how many spaces are available in Priya's flower bed for flowers, given that she already has a certain number of them and we don't know yet if the last one will fit with its space: Divide total length by each plant-space width to see how they can all possibly go together including their 12.5 feet between plants, but without going over, since this calculation might include some partial flowers at end due to remainder from division operation.\n   - Total flower bed length / Each occupied area = Number of spaces available \n   175 ft / (14.5) ≈ 12.07\n3. Given the space constraints and the number already in her possession we can calculate how many she is still short for a full, non-fractional complement: As you cannot buy fractional flowers so round down to nearest whole.\n    - Available spaces rounded = floor(12.07) \n   - 12 spaces available but only need room for new plants so subtract what Priya already has and find the difference that she needs\n     Number of new required flowers  = (Available spaces – existing number)\n      Required flowers: 12-13 isn't correct because we rounded down from a non-whole, meaning there are actually less than 12 whole available with space for one more flower at end so \n    - Total length / plant spacing width and its additional 'space' yields partial of last since the remainder can be used up by just adding another actual full plant (at start not end) before running out\n     Number spaces Priya needs flowers, counting that extra she has room to add = floor(12.07)+1 \n   - 13 is already in flower bed so available slots for purchase must equal number of additional needed which then equals the quantity 'spaces' minus what's being used by existing plants (which we found out could fit more than original count, since remainder lets one extra go there) that are already planted\n     Spaces = floor(12.07)+1 \n   - Since Priya has 13 and she can only plant a whole number of flowers but total spaces available with room to include an additional is actually just enough for all existing ones (including last as its own \"space\") plus one, then how many will be bought?\n     Additional required = floor(12.07)+1 - Existing in flower bed\n    13 spaces - already has: so that would mean we need to subtract only the plant and not a space \n      Required flowers for purchase= Total of 'spaces' including remainder when adding another one (counting existing) – how many plants she currently owns \n   Spaces = floor(12.07)+1 or simply stated Priya can fit 13 but that's already all her current ones so there must be exactly enough to plant a thirteenth flower, since only \"spaces\" including remainder after last full one has been planted is actually the same as existing flowers amount.\n    - This indicates no additional spaces past what she owns \n   Required= total 'available' (counting that extra) minus plants currently in flower bed\n  So Priya can fit just enough for her thirteen but we have not yet figured out if any of these are new so lets count how many will be bought by seeing the difference between existing flowers and available spaces including room to plant an additional whole number after counting remainder - \n   Additional= Spaces with that extra flower (total) – Existing amount\n     Available slots = Total length / Plant+space width + 1 for last full space when partial exists which it does here since we found out total possible was not a perfect multiple of the spacing between flowers.

Since she can peel 7 clams a minute:\n- Time taken for peeling = Total number of clams / Number of clams peeled per minute\nTime taken for peeling = 140 / 7 \nTime taken for peeling = 20 minutes\n\nNext, we need to find out how long it takes Uma to saute the same amount. We know she can sauté 20 clams in 16 minutes.\n- To calculate her rate: Number of clams per time\nHer rate is (20 / 16) or approximately 1.25 clams a minute\n\nWe then find out how long it takes Uma to saute the same amount:\nTime taken for sauting = Total number of clams / Her current sautéing speed \nHowever, in this problem we could also first determine the time needed to sauté per clam and multiply that by 140. Either way is correct.\nFirst let's calculate how many batches she would have if all were equal:\n- Time taken for peeling = Total number of clams / Number of clams peeled per minute\nTime taken for peeling (a batch) = 20 \nTime taken for sautéing a batch = 16\n\nTotal time to peel and cook one batch is: Time taken for peeling + Time taken for sauting\nSo it will take her:\n- Total number of batches * Time in each step / Number of clams per step, so if all steps have the same amount of work \nIf we want total minutes just do (Total time to peel a batch) +  ((140 -20 )/ 7)   and add that result by the sautéing part as well.\n\nHowever there's another more efficient way: calculate how much clams can Uma cook in one minute, since she peels at 1.16 minutes per 10 clams (that is approximately 8.66), so it takes her about (140/20) or seven batches:\n- Each batch would be equal to a total time of \nTime taken for sautéing + Time taken for peeling = Total number of clams / Her current rate in the same step.\nTotal minutes per batch are: 16 minutes, that's from above\nSince we know she has enough time while cooking other batches as well so what matters is only how many total batches and if there will be some leftover to cook afterwards - here it does not matter since after peeling all seven sets of clams in twenty *7 =140 then sautéing can take the same amount of (time) that takes her 112 minutes because each set took sixteen.\n- Total time taken for peeling and sauting a batch: \nTime to peel one hundred forty is equal to seventy times number of batches - since every ten clams adds up an additional minute in addition but it seems she doesn't have any more work while other seven sets are getting ready so we may conclude:\nSince that equals the same as just adding twenty and sixteen together 7x\n- Total time taken = Time for peeling a batch (one hundred forty) + sautéing batches of twenty.\nIn total, there will be: \n140 /20= Seven batches to peel - it takes her about one hour forty minutes in seven sets.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 112.",

She can saute 45 carrots in 11 minutes.\nSo the number of carrots she can saute per minute is:\n45 / 11 = 4.09 (approximately)\nNow we know that for every carrot to be ready, it has to go through peeling and then being sauted by Sophia.\nLet's break down what needs to happen with those 90 carrots: \n- First they have to get peeled which takes a certain amount of time per carrot\nThen after all the carrots are peeled - they need to be cooked. And that also will take some additional time.\n\nFor peeling, she can peel 6 carrots in one minute.\nNow let's find how long it would take for her to peel those 90:\n- We know there is a rate at which Sophia works and we have the amount of work (peel or saute) so we use that. \nPeeling time = Total number of Carrots / Peeling speed per Minute\n= 90 carrots / (6 peels/minute)\nTime to peel all the carrots:\n- Time it takes her is: = 15 minutes\n\nSauteing those peeled carrots - now at this point, Sophia has already spent some amount of worktime and we know that she can sauté so many per minute.\nAnd let's calculate how long would be needed for cooking these after peeling them all:\nTime to cook the carrots =\n= Total number of Carrots / Cooking speed per Minute\n- = 90 carrots / (4.09 cooks/minute)\nNow calculating this gives us an answer that is: \n22 minutes\n\nSince we already know it takes her some amount of time for every step, in order to get a complete total - all you do here now add peeling and cooking times together.\nTotal Time = Peeling + Cooking\n- 15 minute(s) (peel the carrots)\nPlus also additional 22 more minutes \n= 37\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 37.",

      "raw": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate how long it will take Nadia to peel and saute 140 mushrooms.\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. Calculate the time taken for peeling: \n   To find out how many minutes it takes Nadia to peel all 140 mushrooms, divide the total number of mushrooms (140) by her mushroom-peeling rate per minute (14). \n   \n   Time for peeling = Total Mushrooms / Peeling Rate\n                    = 140 / 14\n                    = 10 minutes\n\n2. Calculate how many batches are needed to saute all mushrooms: \n    Since Nadia can only sauté a certain number of mushrooms at once, and we don't have an exact figure for this capacity from the prompt but do know that it's not relevant as long as she is able to cook 20 in one batch. So let’s calculate how many batches are needed:\n   \n   Total Mushrooms / Sautéing Rate per session\n                    = 140 mushrooms / 20 mushrooms \n                    \n    Now, since we're dividing whole numbers and the division isn't exact (7), this implies that she'll have to do an extra sauté batch of a few. As such there are going to be:\n   \n   Batches for Sautéing: Total Mushrooms / Sautéing Rate per session\n                        = 140 mushrooms / 20 mushroom \n                        = 7 full batches.\n\n3. Calculate the time taken for all these saute batches (including the extra partial batch):\n    Since we've now established that a total of seven and one more small portion are required, multiply this number by her rate:\n    \n   Time to cook in minutes: Number of Full Batches * Sautéing Rate per minute + Extra Portion Cook time\n   \n   But for simplicity let’s just assume the final batch (which is not full) still takes 17 minutes. Since that's going to be a tiny portion and won't matter much:\n   \n    Time = Total batches including partial as whole number times the rate \n         = 7 * Sautéing Rate per minute + Extra Portion Cook time\n         \n   We can just multiply by total of eight for simplicity with an adjustment at end.\n    \n    Time to cook in minutes: Number of Batches * Sautéing Rate per batch\n   \n   Because she does one set (20 mushrooms) every 17 mins, do this calculation:\n   \n    Total batches times the rate \n         = 8 batches * time taken\n         \n    So multiply by eight for a total here since we know there are going to be seven full and another not so big portion. And then correct at end.\n\n   Time in minutes: (Number of Full Batches + Portion as batch) * Sautéing Rate per minute \n                    = 8 batches times the sauté rate\n                    \n\n    Since she can cook one set every seventeen mins:\n   \n   Total batches time including partial \n         = 7 full and a portion set at eight sets here now\n   \n    Time to do all of them in minutes is (times taken for each):\n        So since we know this last bit isn't going to be very big just assume the same rate. Then subtract an adjustment.\n   \n   Total batches times seventeen mins per batch \n         = 8 * seventeen minute Sautéing Rate per session\n         \n    Calculate how long she takes in minutes: eight sets of sauté:\n       (We now know that we can multiply this figure by a factor to calculate the time it will take. As follows.)\n   \n   Since Nadia needs 17 mins for every set, let’s do these calculations first.\n    \n     Total batches times seventeen = 136 minute\n   \n    Now subtract from total an adjustment of about one full batch:\n       Adjustment in minutes \n          To adjust: simply subtract a portion which is roughly equivalent to the sauté time per session. Since there are twenty mushrooms and this takes seventeen mins, let’s just take off some number slightly less than that since you don’t need all those seventeens for such small numbers.\n\n   The total batches times minus adjustment now \n       To adjust: simply subtract a portion which is roughly equivalent to the sauté time per session. Since there are twenty mushrooms and this takes seventeen mins, let’s just take off some number slightly less than that since you don’t need all those seventeens for such small numbers.\n   \n   Adjustment = fifteen minutes here (you could use any value smaller but we’ll simply assume 15).\n       To adjust: \n     Total batches minus adjustment now\n    Time taken to cook in minute = total – adjustment\n\n4. Calculate the final time by adding peeling and sautéing times:\n    \nTime for both tasks = Peeling + Sautéing\n   \n   Now calculate this figure.\n\nThe Final Answer is based on calculations, but as a tutor I will do these next:\n\nTotal batches minus an Adjustment of fifteen minutes \n    Time taken to cook in minute\n         = Total – adjustment\n    \nPeel time",

Since she sautes 30 carrots in 5 minutes, this means for every carrot she needs (1/2) * (60 seconds / 5 minutes), or 1/6th of a minute per carrot.\n\nHowever we can calculate the time required more accurately by dividing the total number of carrots to be peeled and then cooked.

Last complex total= Original Total+Extra Apartments \n    So, number in last one is that same amount from extra apartments plus its original amount equal to combined other four:\n    Number of Apartment in the fifth building=(Total Apartments First Four)+extra \n     Which means it also = (600)+( Extra)= 2 * 300\n   Last complex= Total apartment first 4+360 which is:960 \n\n4. We find total number of apartments by summing up all five complexes.\n    The other four have combined total of 600 and fifth one has its own amount, now simply add them to get overall:\n     Overall = (Apartments in the First Four) + Apartments last \n   Total Apartment Combined=600+960 which is:1560\n\n5. Since Qasim collects garbage from each apartment complex 4 times a week.\n    Then we can find how many collection are being made total by multiplying these two numbers:\n     Overall = (Apartments combined * collections per place)\n      We know the other variable for this equation so plug them in now, which is amount he gets paid per \n   Total Collection=1560*4\n  Collections:6240\n\n6. Since Qasim earns ₺0.25 per collection.\n    To find his weekly earnings we multiply total collections with money earned:\n     Weekly Earning = (Collections) * (₺ Money)\n       Now plug in what we do have into equation, and solve for other variable \n   Weekly earning= 6240* (.25)=1560",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we calculate the total number of apartments in the first 6 complexes: \n   Each complex has 200 apartments and there are 6 such complexes.\n   Total apartments = Number of apartment per building * number of buildings\n                     = 200 * 6\n                     = 1200\n\n2. Then we find out how many apartments were at last location:\n   The total from other locations is the previous amount, so it's also equal to 'the first six combined'.\n   Total size for all but one was found in step #1 (which had value of 1200). We now know that this complex\n    has a number of units which is equivalent to half again as many apartments as these. This can be expressed mathematically:\n   Size last location = 'the other six combined' + ('half the size') \n                      = Total from step #1 * (100% + 50%)\n                     = Total from previous steps multiplied by one and a half.\n                      = 1200 * 150%\n                       or alternatively, also equivalent to: 1200 x 3/2\n    therefore last location's total is equal to 1800.\n\n3. Calculate the number of collections per week for all apartment complexes:\n   Mateo collects garbage from each complex 5 times a week and there are a total of 7 such locations.\n   \n4. To find out how many apartments he serves, we need add up step #2 (which was equal to 1200) plus \n    last location's size found in the other previous steps:\n   Total apartment count = Size for all but one + Last building\n                         = Step #1 output number of units *7+ last step value.\n                          which is also alternatively equivalent: to [step #2] + (1800)\n                          therefore, we end up getting 3000. \n\n5. Multiply the total collections per week by the payment he gets for each collection:\n   Mateo collects garbage from a total of 3000 apartments and there are 5 collections in one week.\n    Total number apartment times how many time visit same location per given period = (total apartment) * (#times go to collect waste).\n     which equals 15,000 visits. This is also alternatively expressed: \n   since we found out that each collection was equal to .35 then the amount earned by mateo from this\n    will be total number of times he went collecting trash multiplied by how much money made per time visit a given place.\n   \n6. Calculate Mateo's weekly earnings:\n  Multiply visits * payment per unit, or alternatively put it into an equation form: \n   The formula is : (#times) x (rate for each collection)\n    where #times = total number of times he goes collect waste and rate per time visit a location is given by problem.\n   \n7. Calculation Mateo's weekly income:\n   Total amount earned in week, or alternatively put it into an equation form: \n  The formula here would be : (#visits) x (rate for each collection)\n    where #visits = total number of times he goes collect waste and rate per time visit a location is given by problem.\n   \n   Now the actual values:\n   Total amount earned in week = Mateo's visits * payment \n                               = 15000 * .35\n                              ≈ $5250\n\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 5250.",

      "raw": "\n\nTo find the perimeter of Luca's rectangular study, we need to first determine its width. We know that the area is 300 square meters and the length is 5 meters.\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n1. The formula for the area (A) of a rectangle in terms of its length (l) and width (w) is given as: A = l × w.\n2. Given the values, we can substitute them into this equation to solve for 'w'. So 300 = 5 * w\n3. Divide both sides by 5: w = 300 / 5 \n4. Therefore, the value of width (w) is 60 meters.\n\nNow that we have found Luca's room length and width values as being respectively 5m and 60m, then perimeter can be calculated using this formula:\nThe Perimeter P in terms of its Length l and Width w for a rectangle = P=2(l+w). \n\nTherefore substituting these known values into the equation yields\nP = (2)(l +w) \np = 2(5+60)\nP = (2)(65)\nPerimeter is then given by p=130\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 130.",

Then, we can calculate how much Tariq makes from selling 20 baskets of sunflowers, 21 baskets of orchids, and 40 baskets of roses.\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. Round prices to the nearest dollar:\n   - Sunflower: ₺2.91 ≈ $3\n   - Orchid: ₺5.39 ≈ $5\n   - Rose: ₺6.09 ≈ $6\n\n2. Calculate revenue from sunflowers (20 baskets):\n   20 x $3 = $60\n\n3.

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's determine how much ore one troll can mine per day with each type of tool:\n   - With bare hands: 5 kgs\n   - With a nickel pickaxe: Since the troll mines two times as much, it will be 2 * 5 = 10 kgs\n\n2. Next, we'll find out how much ore one troll can mine per day with a titanium pickaxe:\n   The problem states that trolls mine 70% more than they would have done using nickel tools.\n   To determine this value in kgs: \n   First calculate the difference (70% of what they did mining using a Nickel tool).\n      This means .7 * 10 = 7, so we must add it to the original amount for the pickaxe:\n         So one troll can mine with titanium per day is : 10 + 7 kgs or simply \n   The final calculation should be: (100%+70%) of what they would have done mining using a Nickel tool.\n      Which means that .7 * 10 = 7, and add it to the original amount for pickaxe. Since this was just adding another percentage on top so we can use the percent sign:\n   The value is therefore : (100%+70%) of what they would have done mining using a Nickel tool.\n         Which means that one troll mines: \n        10 *1,7 or simply\n      A simpler calculation will be to say it’s just multiplying by .17 more than was previously. But in this case we had been told the value with pickaxe before titanium and thus easier since have known variable already exists within question so you can multiply:\n   So one troll mines : 10 *1,7 = or simply\n         10 + (70% of what they did mining using a Nickel tool). \n     The final answer is: One Troll will mine with Titanium per day. \n    And since we knew how much he would have done with nickel before can be said that value equals to the following:\n        one troll mines :17 kgs or simply\n       1,7 *10= 17\n\n3. We now need to determine the total amount of ore mined in a month (29 days) by one troll using titanium pickaxes: \n    - Since we determined earlier this would equal 17 so that’s how much is done per day.\n   Multiply it with number of days, since they are going at constant rate every day. That means multiply by the value for each individual kgs to reach final answer:\n     The total will be therefore : (1 troll * 29days) = \n         This equals: one Troll mines in month=17*29 or simply\n    One Troll with titanium pickaxe mine during this time is equal to following result of calculation.\n       That would mean that the value should become for what a single person can do over the entire length. Or using our last answer and just multiply it by 29:\n     The final amount mined per troll in one month =17* 29=493.\n\n4. To determine how many kgs of ore are mined with titanium pickaxes, we'll calculate total number for all trolls.\n    In this case that will be equal to: (20trolls * the previously calculated result which is what was found out about each troll mining) or \n   - We simply multiply by 20 and keep our other values constant:\n     Total amount mined =493*20=9860 \n\nAnswer: The final answer is 9860.",

First, we calculate how many hours he works per week by multiplying the number of days worked and the shift length: \n   Hours/week = Shift/day * Days/Week\n               = 9 hour/day * 3 day/week \n               = 27 hour/week\n\n2.

Since a goat needs 8 kilograms and a cow needs 8 kilograms less than twice that amount:\n1) Calculate the amount for one cow: Twice the amount for a goat is (2 * 8 kg = 16 kg). Eight kilograms less would be (16 - 8 kg = 8 kg).\n\nHowever, according to problem statement \"each cow needs 8 kilograms less than twice the amount each goat needs\" we should calculate it as:\nTwice of goat's need: 2*8kg=16kg \nEight kilogram less from that is :  2 * 8 - 8 = (2-1)*8 kg = 8 kg.\n\nHowever this was a wrong interpretation, lets try again. According to problem statement \"each cow needs 8 kilograms less than twice the amount each goat needs\"\nThe correct calculation for one cow would be: \nTwice of goat's need : 16kg.\n Eight kilogram less from that is indeed (2*8)-8 = 8 kg.\n\nBut actually its not. Because, lets see problem statement again \"each cow needs 8 kilograms LESS THAN TWICE THE AMOUNT EACH GOAT NEEDS\". So it would be \nTwice of goat's need : 16kg\n Eight kilogram less from that is indeed (2*8)-8 = (1) * (8+8-8)= 8 + (8 - 8). \n\nHowever we do \"twice\" first then subtract, therefore:  \n= Twice the amount each goat needs: 8 kg * 2\nThen eight kilograms less from that is indeed : \nTwice of goat's need = 16kg.\n Eight kilogram less from that would be (16 - 8)kg which equals to  (1)*(8+8-8)=8+(8-8).\nHowever we do \"twice\" first then subtract, therefore:\n(2 * 8 kg)-8 kg= \n2*8-8 = \n= Twice the amount each goat needs: 16 kg.\nThen eight kilograms less from that is indeed : (16 - 8)kg which equals to \n2*(8-4)=\nTwice of goats need, minus \"one\" times four would be:\n(1)*(8+8)-(1*4)\n=(2)*8-(1*4)=(1)*(2*8 -(1*4))\nHowever we do the calculation in following order: First multiply by 2 then subtract.\nSo (first) twice of goats need, minus \"one\" times four would be:\nFirstly calculate : \nTwice of goat's amount =16kg\nThen eight kilograms less from that is indeed \n(8+8-4)=12 kg\n\nNow lets verify our answer with another method. Problem statement says: 8 kilogram LESS THAN TWICE THE AMOUNT EACH GOAT NEEDS.\nSo if we calculate it as follows:\nTwice of goat's need = (2) * Goats amount\n= Twice the amount each goat needs \nAnd then \"eight kilograms\" less from that, is actually same with subtracting one times four: \n(1)*(4)\nFrom twice of goats need. Which gives us to : (first multiply by two and then do subtraction operation).\nThe correct calculation for cow's hay would be:\n= Twice the amount each goat needs\nFirstly we calculate it as 2*8 kg =16kg.\nThen eight kilograms less from that is indeed \n(1)*(4) kilogram. That means subtracting (one times four). Then result will become to : \nTwice of goats need minus one time fours would be:\n=(first multiply by two then do subtraction)\n= Twice the amount each goat needs: 16 kg\nThen eight kilograms less from that is indeed \n(8+4)=12kg. Which becomes equal with following expression :\n(Twice - four) = (2 * Goats need)-1*four.\nHowever we know goats need as \"eight\" then calculation would become to:\n=Twice of goat's amount minus one times fours which equals 16-4= \n=(8+8)-(0+4)=12kg. Which means actually that is correct answer for cow needs.\n\nNow lets verify our result with another method.\nFirstly we multiply by two, and then subtract four from it:\nGoat need as \"eight\" kilogram : Goats amount = 8 kg\nThen twice the goat's need would become to: \n2 * Goat's amount=16kg\nHowever according problem statement cow needs eight kilograms less than that. So actually calculation should be done in following order.\nFirstly calculate (twice) then do subtraction operation of four, which gives us result as follows:\nTwice - Four = 12 kg\n\nWe know cows need is \"eight\" kilogram LESS THAN TWICE THE AMOUNT",

Thus Yusufs current age should equal 43 x2, and then subtract 60 from this to find out how old yusuf is on first sighting\n3. Let us calculate it.\n4. Grandfather's age = 43 years \n5. The time when Yusuf saw the comet second time he was two times older than his grandfather that is 86 years so, we have seen a full orbit and another year where Yusufs current age equals this value which makes him to be equal in grandfathers terms (double of) as Grandfather's = double \n6. Now subtracting an orbital period from it will give us yusuf's first sighting age\n   First Sighting Age 86 -60 \n\nAnswer: The final answer is 26",

The grandfather saw the comet at 32 years.\n2. Viktor saw it a second time when he was three times as old as his grandfather (3 * 32 = 96).\n\nNow that we have Viktor's age during the second sighting, let's think about how long ago this event occurred relative to Comet Encke's orbit of every 75 years.\n\nViktor would also be older by a difference equal to one complete orbital period when he saw it for his first time. So if you subtract 75 from his last known viewing age (96) that should tell us Viktor was how old during the prior sighting.\n \nTherefore, we can conclude:\n(96 - 75 = 21).\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 21",

Since Comet Halley orbits every 80 years, this means that for anyone to see it again after they have seen it once, they must wait another 80 years before seeing it a second time.\n3. When Mateo sees the comet for the SECOND TIME at an age which is twice as much of his dad's first sighting (2 * 43 = 86), we know he has already waited out one full orbit period to see this Comet again after having seen it once in his life before, hence when Mateo saw the Comet FIRST time, was exactly a whole cycle prior.\n4. So if you backtrack from the point of second sighting by 80 years - then that gives us age at which he first spotted comet Halley \n   Hence we do 86 (age of mateo on seeing it SECOND TIME) minus another full orbit i.e., 80 years = Mateos's age when he saw Comet for FIRST time.\n5. The calculation is as follows:\nAge_of_Mateo_on_second_sighting - Full_orbit_time= Age_at_first_Seeing\n86-80 =6\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 6",

    "logic_problem": {
      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \nFirst, we need to calculate the total weight of all trouts Wei caught. We know that he caught 4 trouts and their weights are as follows:\n- The first trout weighs 70 kilograms.\n- The second trout weighs 33 kilograms.\n- The last (fourth) trout weighs 32 kilograms.\n\nWe still don't have information about the third trout, but we can infer it's weight from the given data: \nWei caught a total of four trouts and he knows their weights. We are told that Wei weighed all his catches except for one which is unknown to us in this scenario so far (third). However there isn't any more fish left after mentioning 1st, 2nd, & last trout - hence it must be the third.\n\nThe problem states \"the first\", then \"second\" and finally \"last\". It's obvious from here that Wei caught four fishes which can also mean \n- First (which is one of them), Second (another) so left are two now. Out of those 2, if last means fourth - remaining fish has to be third.\nTherefore: the unknown weight must belong to trout three.\n\nTo calculate its value we have information on total trouts but no more individual values other than first second & last one hence assume a hypothetical example where suppose he got all equal weights which is not our case here as these are different still lets see what would happen if they were same in this particular scenario. So with 70+33 and 32, that sums up to be 135 for three fish of ours - now divide it by number of fishes we have (3) so value will become approximately equal to ~45 kilograms per trout which was supposed but here the fact is first second & last values aren't same so this isn't correct weight still lets use as no information given. So that's 70+33 =103 for two trouts and adding an imaginary third one gives us (hypothetical)~148 now add value of fourth fish - our answer will be: \n- Total weight of four trout Wei caught is approximately equal to or exactly the sum total of all three known & a hypothetical example which isn't correct because in this we don't know what's exact figure for third one but lets calculate it by simply adding (for first, second and last): 70 +33+32 =135. And if there were four trouts as given - so that would mean: Total weight is equal to or sum of all weights which are known & unknown here because we know three fishes' value out of total number of fish caught by Wei on Sunday.\n\nNow using our assumption made above where a hypothetical third trout has been assumed to weigh ~45 kg (still not accurate as given first second and last but no info about the third) still lets try dividing this particular sum with actual numbers i.e 135 for three fishes now add one more value & divide it by total number of trouts so in our case, we get:\n~148/4 =37kg. So again approximately or roughly a trout weighs ~40 kg which isn't correct because only first second last are given not third.\n- However as this is the situation here - lets use values that have been provided & simply add them up to calculate total value of trouts caught by Wei on Sunday:\nTotal weight = 70+33 +32=135 for three fishes now using assumption made above where we assumed ~45kg trout but it isn't correct because only first second last are known not third still lets see: \n~148/4=~37. So that's how much one fish weighs approximately if there were equal weights which is wrong here so simply add up the value of fourth unknown (third) in this case by finding difference from total possible weight (~40* 4 =160kg & subtracting sum values for three fishes - known ones).\nNow finally we are getting somewhere as to what could possibly be third one: \nThird trout's value= Total Value if they were all equal/each-Total weights of trouts caught so far by Wei which is (three) known:\n~ 40 *4 = ~160kg and subtracting it with values for first second last gives us\n Third unknown weight=(160 -135)=25 kilograms.\n \nNow we know the third trout's value. Now that we have all four weights, let's calculate total weight of trouts caught by Wei on Sunday:\nTotal weight= First + Second+Third + Last (Fourth)\n70 kg for first one 33kg second & last is given as 32 - now only unknown was left so it has been found out above which turned to be ~25 kilograms.\n \nSo: Total value = 70+33+~25+32=~160 kilogram\n \n- Now that we have the total weight of all trouts Wei caught, let's calculate how much he will earn after selling them at €1.0 per kg:\nWei earns= (Total Weight) * Price Per KG \nSo price here is given",

The weights of three salmons are given: 45 kg (first), 33 kg (second), and 36 kg (last).\n2. However, there is a third salmon in between them whose weight isn't mentioned.\n3. Total number of salmons caught = 7\n4. We can find the total weight by adding up all weights but one of the middle four are not given so we will use those three that have been provided to calculate how much they sold for: \n   first, second and last salmon's combined weight is (45 kg + 33 kg + 36 kg) = 114 kgs.\n5. Since there was no other weights mentioned let’s multiply by the total number of salmons caught - those we are missing in this equation will be represented with an 'x'.\n   Umar has a total salmon catch that he can sell which is (7 * x)\n6. Let us calculate how much money does 114 kgs represent: \n    ₣1.5 per kilogram times the amount of kilograms sold from those three salmons gives you, \n    (45 + 33 +36) = 114 kg\n   Now multiply by ₣1.5:\n    Total for first second and last salmon caught is then equal to 114 * 1.50 = ₣171.\n7. However this doesn’t solve the problem since we don't know what other four weigh so lets assume average weight of remaining salmons must be approximately close enough with given data that they are all similar in size - it can be done by getting their mean (average) value:\n   Average salmon's weight = total_weight_of_salmon_we_know / 3 \n                           =(114 kg)/3\n                           ≈38.00kg.\n8. We have an average now which means the other four weigh on avg approximately 152 kgs,\n    since we are using averages, lets assume all of these middle ones will also be equal to this value and multiply by ₣1.5:\n   (4 * 38 kg) = 152 kg\n9. Multiply total kilograms for average sized salmon with cost per kilogram \n    which gives you the amount earned from rest four fish caught at market.\n     Total money made selling other salmons: \n       152 kgs x ₣1.5/kg ≈₣228  \n10.

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \nFirst, we need to find the total weight of all 5 salmons. We know the weights of three salmons (78 pounds + 50 pounds + 25 pounds) and since there is no information about other two, let's call them 'x' pound salmon.\n\nTotal Weight = First Salmon + Second Salmon + Last Salmon \nSince we don't have exact weight for remaining 2 fish so this can be rewritten as:\n= Total of known weights + unknown total\nHowever the problem states he caught five. Two more were not listed but to calculate their worth they are assumed in with all others.\n\nThe price is given per pound and Noah will sell them at a rate of ¥2/pound.\nKnown Salmon Weights: First 78, second salmon =50 third or last one =25 \nFirst add known weights together:\nTotal for three fish = (first +second+third)or(known)=153 \n\nBecause he caught five but the price is by pound just multiply all his catchs which would be x5= number of salmons.\nSince we do not know how much 4th and fifth ones weigh lets assume they both together will have a weight such that:\nTotal salmon = Total for three fish + unknown two \nlets call total of other fishes as: \"the other two\" or TOT2. The sum is known since there are five (5). But you still do not know how much the last 2 salmons weigh but it does say he caught five in problem.\nSo first multiply by rate to get money and assume all fish weight will be = Total Salmon Weight so lets denote that as TSW.\n\nTotal for three fishes is already given which equals: \n78 +50+25=153 \n\nSince price per pound was ¥2.0, you need total salmon weight x  the rate\nlets calculate it.\nTo get money multiply by rate (¥/pound) so we have:\nMoney = Total Salmon Weight(TSW)x Rate or R\n\nSo to make calculation easy lets call unknown fishes as 'x' and use equation for first three known fish. \nTotal Money Noah will earn can be found out when you know total weight of five salmons he caught which is given by rate times the weight.\nSince we do not have weights for last two fishes, let us find average:\nAverage Weight Per Fish =  Total Known / number of known fishes\nAWPF=153/3 \n=51 pound \n\nThis would mean each fish weighs an avg. of ¥102 so if you multiply this with total five salmons or x5.\nTotal money Noah will make when he sells these is rate times the weight which can be written in equation as:\nTMR = TRWx R\nwhere TMR denotes Total Money Rate,TRW=TSW=total salmon weight and we have calculated that already so lets find this first.\n\nThe total weight of all fishes since each fish weighs on avg ¥51 pound is given by 5x AWPF or average times the number which gives us \nTotal Salmon Weight = Average x N (where 'N' denotes no. of salmons)\nTSW=AWPx N\nWe know that there are five(Noah caught five) so lets substitute values to get total salmon weight.\nTotal Salmon Weights(TSW)= 51x5 \n\nlets find this:\nSo TSW or the Total Salmon Weight is given by ¥255.\n\nNow since we have found out how much Noah will make. It was simply rate times weight \nTotal Money Noah Will Make When He Sells The Five Salmons Is Given By Rate x (or times) weight\nTMRx=TRWXR\n\n¥2/pound x  total salmon Weight = TSWx R or ¥2/ pound X255 pounds.\n\nlets calculate this:\nMoney Noah will earn after selling all five salmons is \nTotal Money(TS)xR=(rate)(weight)\n¥(TSWR)= ¥510 \n\nAnswer: The final answer is 510.",

      "question": "There are 7 periods in the day for a normal student but Jamal has to take 2 extra classes. Each class is 35 minutes long. He goes to class for 6 days a week. He then spends five-sixths of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?",

      "answer": 84.0
    },
    "logic_problem": {
      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's calculate the number of periods Jamal has in a day: 7 (normal) + 2 (extra classes) = 9 periods/day.\n2. Since each class is 35 minutes long, we can find out how many minutes he spends learning per day: 9 * 35 minutes/period = 315 minutes/day.\n3. Now let's convert the total number of daily minutes to hours for easier calculations later on: 315 / 60 (minutes in an hour) ≈ 5.25 hours/day, but we will keep using minute values so our result is precise\n4. Next, Jamal goes to class for 6 days a week, and he also spends extra learning time over the weekend. For his normal classes during weekdays: He attends school for six of those seven days which are all with nine periods *sixty minutes / day. So we calculate total weekly hours spent at school from that first as (9*35) * 6 = 1890.\n5. Now, Jamal spends five-sixths of the time he would normally spend on Saturday and Sunday each for learning: Let's represent his normal class times with a variable Y here, so if Y is equal to how many minutes are spent in school then that means (Y/2) * 6 / 7 = Extra Learning. So using our known total hours from weekdays we can derive the extra weekend time by realizing he has seven days of classes but only attends six and each class day takes up an equivalent amount so his actual value for Y is equal to what was derived previously which means that ((1890/6) * 2 ) * (5 / 6) = Extra Weekend Learning. \n   Since this represents minutes, we must then multiply it by the total number of weekend days he attends classes - in this case two or Saturday and Sunday: So now our new value for extra learning time is equal to ((1890/6) *2)*10 / 7 which simplifies into (630*5)=3150. Now let's convert that back to hours by dividing the number of minutes per hour so we get a total of: \n   Extra weekend Learning Time ≈ 52.50\n6. Lastly, he has his normal class time from weekdays plus any extra learning on weekends which is equal to (1890 + 3150) =5040 or when converted into hours spent equals approximately: \n5040/60=84 \n\nSo we can add the values together now and convert back for total weekly hours ≈ 84\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 84",

He goes to classes for 4 days in the week so weekly time spent is ((9 * 50)* 4)/60 hours/week which gives us (30*3)=90hours isn't correct we have extra periods and a better way of writing this would be total weekly class mins are (8+1) * 50mins =450, multiply that by the number of days in school per week. This is 9 classes/day times four for each day of school then divide to find how many hours spent: ((9*4)*50)/60.\n3. So now we know he spends (30) mins a day so total weekly class time is ((8+1) * 4 days)=36 periods, multiply this number by the amount of minutes in that one period and it would give us his school week which we'll divide to find hours spent during regular school weeks: Total mins/60=total hours. Since Wei has (9 classes/day)*50mins/class then (450*4)/60 = 30.\n4. Then calculate total time he spends learning on the weekends, or ((1/4) * weekly class mins), which will also be in minutes and convert it to hours by dividing this number by sixty so now we have one fourth of his school week: since Wei has (450*4)/60= 30 then four times that divided into a quarter would give us the weekend time spent learning, multiply by 1/4 for saturday or sunday. ((450 *4) /240 = 7.5.\n5. Add both values together to get his total weekly hours of school: \n   So now add them all up so we know that he spends (30+3 + 3)=36hrs during the week.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 36",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \n\nMateo spent ₺1200 and had 6% of his money left in change. First, we need to find out how much he actually spent on snacks.\nTo do this, let's calculate the amount of change Mateo got:\n₺1200 * (6/100) = ₺72\n\nNow that we know how much change Mateo received, we can determine the total cost of his purchase by subtracting the change from the original amount he paid with: \n₺1200 - ₺72 = ₺1128 \n\nWe also know that Mateo bought 9 bags of popcorn. Since each bag costs 75 cents (or ₺0.75), we can find out how much money was spent on these by multiplying their cost per unit and quantity:\n9 * ₺0.75 = ₺6.75\n\nSince the total purchase price is in Turkish lira, let's convert popcorn to Turkish Liras: \n₺1128 - ₺6.75 ≈ ₺1121.25 \n\nWe also know that he bought some cookies for 125 cents (or approximately ₺1.25 each). To calculate how many cookies Mateo purchased with the remaining money:\nFirst, we must convert his spending to Turkish Lira \n₺1128 - ₺6.75 ≈ ₺1121.25 \n\nThen subtract popcorn from total spent\nWe are using 1121 for simplicity purposes here (since this problem does not allow decimal answers). So: \n1121 - 675 = 446\n\nDivide the remaining amount by cost per unit of cookies:\n446 ÷ 125 = 3.568 ≈ 4 \n\nHowever, it makes no sense to round up since you cannot purchase a fraction of an item; thus rounding down is our only logical choice.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 3",

We know he bought 3 bags of cookies at $0.50 each.\nTotal cost for cookies = Number of cookie bags * Cost per bag\nTotal cost for cookies = 3 * 0.5 \nTotal cost for cookies = $1.50\n\nSince we are given that the total amount spent is in cents equivalent to a dollar value ($900), let's convert this into dollars and also calculate how much was left.\nDiego had 3% of his money as change after spending, which means he actually used (100 - 3)% = 97%.\nSo Diego used $900 * (97/100) for the purchase.\n\nNow converting dollar amount to cents equivalent in a calculation we use:\n$1 is equal to 100 cents.\nThe total spent was then: \n(900 dollars)*((100cents)/(1dollar))*(97/100)\n= ($9)*(100)*(97/100).\nAs all other values are already defined by the problem statement as dollar amount and percentage, $ conversion isn't needed:\nUsed money in cents =  (900*100) * (97/100).\n\nThis evaluates to: \n$90,000(cent value of dollars)*0.97\n=87,300.\n\nDiego also bought popcorn for some part of this total cost.\nWe know he had a change so the used amount must be subtracted from $9 which is equivalent 900 cents in dollar terms and converted into (900 *100)cents to get cent values or:\nUsed money = Total spent - Change \nChange was: ($9)*(3/100)\n$0.27 \n\nHence total used by diego equals\n(90,000)-(270)=89,730.\n\nSince he bought 3 cookies at $1.50 we can find out popcorn cost.\nLet the number of bags be x then:\n(x)(75) + (150 cents for cookie purchase).\nNow set it equal to total money spent \n$89730 = (x*75)+ 150\n\nThen subtracting both sides by 150\n(89,730 - 150)= (x *75)\n=8980.\n\nSolving this equation: x equals:\n(x)=(8980/75).\n\nTherefore after computation we get a decimal and rounding down as no of bags will always be integer,\nNumber of popcorn = [89880/75] \nwhich is roughly\n120.\n\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 120",

    "logic_problem": {
      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \nFirst, let's calculate the amount Qasim spent on popcorn. 5 bags of popcorn for 35 cents each is 5 * 0.35 = $1.75.\n\nSince he had 8% of his money left in change after spending ₣500 (which we will assume to be equal to dollars), that means the total change he received was 8/100 x 500 = 40 dollars.\n\nSo, Qasim spent a total of 500 - 40 = $460 on snacks. Subtracting what he spent on popcorn ($1.75 * 100 is 175 cents and we will assume ₣ to be equal to dollar so the conversion rate from ₣ to dollar would have no effect here) leaves us with the amount Qasim spent on pretzels, which is $460 - $1.75 = $458.25.\n\nSince each pretzel costs 0.75 dollars (or cents *100), we divide this by 0.75 and get that he bought approximately a number very close to but not exceeding integer value of the result when doing so: 610.33... So Qasim would have spent no more than $457.5 on pretzels if all his change was from buying an integral amount, thus allowing us for final rounding down answer.\n\nThe money remaining unspent is less than price to buy a single extra bag of popcorn - and definitely also will be the same with any other possible purchase here (of course we can calculate this number by doing: 500-458.25=41.75). Thus it makes no difference as long value in dollars used for calculation purposes.\n\nTherefore Qasim bought 610 pretzels because he could buy only full bags of them.\n\n\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 610",

Therefore lets simplify by verifying through given variables.\n\nMoney left: (9/100) * total money\n= 81\n\nThen total value spent is:\n₺900 - ₺81 = ₺819 \n\nNow let's calculate popcorn and pretzel values separately first, then combine them to check if we can get the desired result.\nHowever this was already calculated above.\n\nLet's re-evaluate what has been done so far. We have determined that Arash spent a total of ₺819 on both snacks (popcorn and pretzels), with 5 bags of popcorn costing him:\n₺0.15 in liras, however we can convert it back to cents by multiplying the value obtained above by 100 since there are hundred cent for each Lira.\nThis is not correct as given below:\n\nArash bought five popcorns so total money spent on them would be \n5 * ₺30 (cent) =₺150 in cents.\n\nHowever this needs conversion into",

Hence RT = T/3 = 2 hours \n     Walking Time (WT) is two-thirds of T. WT = 4 hours\n   The remaining time must have been spent skipping: Skipping Time(ST) would be the difference between total and running/walking times, that will result to ST=0 as it was given she has only walked or ran for most of her travel.\n\n   Distance covered in each activity can now be calculated:\n     Running distance = 10 mph * (2 hours)    = 20 miles \n     Walking distance = 2.5 mph * (4 hours) = 10 miles\n     Skipping is zero since all the time she was either walking or running\n\n4.

Since there are nine times as many bananas as persimmons initially, we can calculate the initial number of bananas:\n   Initial Bananas = 9 * Initial Persimmons\n                    = 9 * 66 \n                    = 594\n\n3. Yuki bought more persimmons at the store: 63.\n   So now he has a total of (Initial + Bought) persimmons in his house, which is:\n   Total Persimmons = 66 (initially had) + 63\n                     = 129\n\n4. Now when buying bananas Yuki bought 44 fewer than what number of new persimmons were purchased.\n   New Bananas Purchased: Since he has a total of nine times the initial amount and now since we know that for every persimmon there are going to be more, however here it's specified (63) is less by an order of forty-four so let us add 44 then multiply this value:\n                    = ((New Persimmons + Initial bananas' equivalent - New persimmons purchased ) * 9)- Total Bananas he had at his house initially\n   Since new banana amount was based on the newly added and thus a calculation would be (Initial persimmon count + Added persimmon) / initial persimmons = Multiplier to multiply with number of Persimmonds Yuki bought.\n                    Thus we get \n    63 * ((66+129)/66)\n   New Bananas Purchased: \n                  Since this value can also be calculated using the following formula (New persimmon amount) -44:\n                   New bananas purchased = 9*63-44\n =567-44\n =523\n\n5. However we've to calculate from where did he get those values so that's why let us do step by step process as mentioned below: \n    We now have Total Persimmons (129) and since Yuki has bought new persimmon count then 9 * ((Initial + Added)/ Initial ) multiplier should be applied which results into multiplying value of the New bananas purchased using initial banana values, we can apply above logic in terms of calculation as follows:\n      Since he already had a total number of Banana (594) and now he is buying more to it i.e \n    Total Bananas = 9 * ((Initial + Added)/ Initial ) multiplier for persimmons Yuki bought.\n   Let's simplify this problem we can directly multiply new bananas purchased using initial persimmon count then add those numbers as well which makes us get:\n      New banana purchase would be equal to (New Persimmonds -44) so the calculation should look like: \n    9 *63-44 = 523\n   Thus Yuki has bought more Banana's now we need Total Count of Bananas and persimmons that will be calculated as follows:\n\n6. Now let us find out what is total count:\n      We have got number for bananas in step 5 which was (594 + New banana purchased ) and a value for Persimmomns from Step 3.\n     So the final answer should look like: \n   Total Count = Bananas+Persimmons\n               = Initial Banana's Value(Which we already know) + New Banana's Purchased(From step 5) +Total persimmon count ( From step 4)\n              =(594)+523+(129)\n\nStep by step reasoning:\nAnswer: The final answer is 1246",

So we subtract that difference from his original quantity to get the updated amount. The relation for buying more persimmons and their difference with orange, can be defined as:\nP_new = O_new - 35  \nP_new = 133 - 35\nP_new = 98 \n\nSo total number of oranges is now: \nO_new + P_new \n= (73+60) + (438-35)\nor simply add the new values we have found for both.

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \nFirst, let's identify the number of bananas Leon initially has in his house. The problem states that he started with 93 bananas.\nNext, we need to find out how many apples were there at home. It is mentioned that \"there are ten times as many apples as bananas\". Thus if B=bananas then A =10B (A =Apples). \nSince Leon had 93 bananas so the number of Apples will be 10*93 which equals 930.\nLeon bought more fruits from a store, he added to his fruit collection by buying \"42 more bananas\" and since there are now fewer apples than banana in this purchase then it is safe to say that we have an addition of (93+42) =135 bananas. \nSimilarly Leon also had \"25 fewer apples than the number of bananas\". Therefore for each 100 added Bananas he bought, only 75 more Apples were purchased so if there are now a total of (93 + 42)= 135 bananas then that is an additional purchase of 42 new bananas which will mean we add to our fruit collection by buying (42 -25) =17 apples. \nThis makes the final number for Banana, in this case: B= 93+ 42 and Apples A=(930+17).\nNow let's find out how many fruits he now has at his home.\nNumber of Bananas that Leon finally had will be 135 (which is equal to initial bananas plus bought ones), i.e. \nB = 135\nA =(10 * B)+ 17 or it could also be represented as A=(930+17).\nUsing both methods we have the number for Apples, which turns out to be: \n(10*93) +42-25=930+17.\nThe value of total apples is equal in any method used so that is:\nA = ( 935 ) or\n   =(1070 -135)+ 100  \n   =935 .\nFinally let's find the combined number of fruits, which can be obtained by adding all values i.e. B + A \n    Combining both Banana and Apple quantities gives us: The final total for Bananas is:\nB= (93+42) or it could also have been written as 135.\nAnd so that makes Apples value to equal\nA=(930+17)=935,\nCombining them together will give the following results below. \n( B + A ) = Final result \n\nThe final answer is: The final answer is 1070",

On a hot day he takes twice as long to swim, plus two more than on cold days.\nOn a \"hot\" water day = (24 * 2) + 2 minutes\nHot day time is also 50 min \n\nThe question was comparing warm vs cold but gave the times for 'cold' and 'warm', let's use those. \nSo now that we know Esteban takes 50 minutes to swim a kilometer when it is \"hot\" or just \"warm\", (his swimming speed doesn't differ between these two), and he takes only 24 min in cold, the difference can be found by multiplying this per-kilometre time-difference with total distance.\n\nThe question was comparing 'cold' vs hot day so we use: \nTime to swim a kilometer on warm or \"hot\" = 50 minutes.\nTime to swim when it's cold is 24 min\n\n6 kilometers * (difference in the times between swimming one kilometre under both conditions) will provide us with our answer.\n\nNow, let's calculate that time-difference and multiply this value by total distance i.e. six kilometer:\nThe difference of per-kilometre swim time = warm - cold\n= 50 min -24 \nTime diff in minutes is: (6 * 26)\nAnswer: The final answer is 156",

When the water is warm, he takes two times as long to swim a kilometer plus an additional 6 minutes. This means that his time for swimming one kilometer on a hot day can be calculated by multiplying the original time (when it's cold) with two and then adding six more minutes: \n    Time taken when warm = 2 * Time taken when cold + 6\n3. We already know Sanjay takes 22 minutes to swim in cold water, so let's substitute that value:\n   Time taken when warm = 2 * (22) + 6\n4.

Since we know how long Sanjay takes to swim one kilometer in both cold and warm water, now let's find out his total swimming time of three kilometers for each condition:\n   Total time on a hot day (3 km) = Time taken when warm * Number_of_km\n = 50 minutes/km * 3 \n = 150 minutes.\n6.

This totals out as follows:\n¥6 (mini golf) + ¥5 (arcade tokens)= ¥11\n\nHer budget per guest, excluding Emma's own activities is just go-kart rides of: 3 * ¥13 = ¥39.\nNow we calculate how many friends can be invited by first subtracting the total cost that applies only to her from the overall budget:\n¥250 - ¥50 (her personal mini-golf and arcade tokens plus one set of three kart-rides) is not accurate. \nThe correct approach should take into account just Emma's costs for activities applicable once, then calculate per guest.\nWe will subtract her fixed cost: ¥11 + 3 * ¥13 = ¥56 from the budget leaving us with\n¥250 - ¥50 (her personal mini-golf and arcade tokens plus one set of three kart-rides) is not accurate. We should instead do \n¥250 - ¥11 for Emma's activities applied once, which leaves:\n¥239 \n\nNow subtract go-kart rides just for her from the total budget to isolate guest costs:  \nSince we already know that she will ride 3 times at a cost of ¥13 per time and that this is included in our prior subtraction. \nWe'll only consider other people's (guests') costs, knowing hers are covered within the subtractions above.\n¥239 - ¥39 for her go-kart rides leaves us with\n¥200 \n\nGuests can have their own mini-golf at a cost of: 6 * number_of_guests = \nTheir arcade tokens will be ¥5 each. We now calculate guest costs per person in terms of total and solve:\n¥11 + ¥39 is the full amount for Emma, so we remove her go-kart rides (¥39) as well as fixed non-guest costs.\nNow just considering guests' mini golf & token: \n6 * number_of_guests = cost of all their mini-golf\n5 * number_of_guests =  total tokens \n\n11*number_of_guess = combined guest costs, with Emma's prior removal. This leaves us a remainder budget after her ¥50 in expenses and will be used to determine the remaining possible guests.\nSo we now solve for this equation as follows:\n¥200 / ¥50 per person \nTo find how many friends can come given their own round of mini-golf at 6 dollars, arcade tokens (5), and three go-kart rides each.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 4",

The total cost will be ₣5 (bowling) + ₣3 (game room tokens), and since each friend also rides 7 times on bumper cars at ₣6 per ride the equation becomes: \nTotal Cost = x(₣5 for bowling + ₣3 game room token + ₣42, that is 7 * ₣6 cost of riding a bumper car) \n\nThe total budget allocated to Jasmine by her dad was ₣250. Since this also includes herself and we know she can invite 'x' friends so the equation becomes \n(₣5+₣3+₣42)*(1+x)= ₣250.\nSimplifying, (50*x)+(51) = 250; subtracting 51 on each side gives us: 50 * x=199. Dividing both sides by 50 we get:\nx=3.98 \n\nSince the number of friends can only be a whole number and not in decimals so rounding down this value Jasmine could invite '4' is incorrect she cannot afford it, but since her cost does include herself as well therefore when you calculate using x =3 that becomes\nTotal Cost =(₣5+₣42 + ₣3) * (1+x), Total cost= 50*(x+1)=50*4; which gives us the total of: \n200.\n\nSince Jasmine can afford it and also she is included in this 'x' so x =3 represents number of friends here not including her.

The problem requires us to determine the number of dozens, so we will divide this value by twelve since there are a dozen eggs in every set.\n   Dozens_of_eggs_needed_for_156_days = Total_eggs_needed_for_156_days / 12\n = 720/12 \n = 60\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 60.",
