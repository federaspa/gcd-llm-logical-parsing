We need to check the first part of Premise 6: \"Bonnie both attends and is very engaged with school events.\"\n4. To do this, we consider what would happen if Bonnie did not attend or engage with school events:\n   - If Bonnie neither performs in talent shows nor engages with other events (contradiction to step 1), she must be inactive and disinterested members of her community.\n5. However, all people who are inactive and disinterested members chaperone high school dances (Premise 8).

The first premise states: \"If people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events.\"\n   - This means that if Bonnie performs often in talent shows, she attends and is engaged with school events.\n\n3. The second premise states:\n  - \"People either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community.\"\n\n4. The third premise says: “If people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school.\"\n   - This means if Bonnie is a dance chaperon, she cannot be a student.\n\n5. The fourth premise states:\n  - \"All people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.\"\n\n6. The fifth premise says: “All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.”\n   - This means if Bonnie wants to advance academically, she is a student attending the school.\n\n7. Finally, we have the statement about Bonnie:\n  - \"Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school,\n    or she neither attends nor is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school.\"\n\n8. Now let's analyze the conclusion: “If Bonnie is either both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career\nand educational opportunities, and chaperones high school dances, then Bonnie is either a student who attends the school,\nor an inactive member of their community.”\n\n9. Let’s break down this statement:\n   - If Bonnie wants to advance academically (young/teenager wishing for better education) but also chaperons high school dances.\n     Given she can't be both, and from the premises we know that if she is a chaperon, she's not a student.\n\n10. So either:\n    - She’s an inactive member of her community because being a young child/teenager who wants to further education means\n      she would need to attend school which contradicts with chaperoning high school dances.\n     Or,\n    - Bonnie neither attends nor is very engaged and thus must be an inactive disinterested member.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion matches logically as true based on given premises.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is True.",

Evaluating Bonnie's possible states under **Premise 2**:\n   - If Bonnie is an inactive member of the community then R → C.\n       (This implies she chaperones dances)\n\n5.

Employees either have lunch in the company or at home.\n\nLet's break down James' situation:\n4. We know from premise 5: No managers work remotely from home; thus if James is a manager, he cannot work remotely but only works within the company.\n5. From the conclusion we are given about James, \"James is either a manager and appears in the company today or neither a manager nor appears in the company today.\"\n\nThis means:\n- If James is not a manager (neither), then from premise 6: since he does appear today but only if he's a manager, so it must be that James is indeed a manager.\n   - Therefore, James cannot work remotely; hence, he has lunch at home.\n\nGiven the logic flow above:\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n- Since no managers are allowed to have remote work (premise 5), and James being identified as either appearing in company or not both times must be a manager if present today.\n   - This aligns with his presence because only managers appear on days they're scheduled.\n\nTherefore, since he is a manager who appears in the office:\n6. He schedules meetings and hence has lunch at home (premise 4).\n7.

Employees can either have lunch in the company or at home.

If an employee works remotely from home, they are either in other countries (Premise 5) or have to be working at their home office since managers can't work remote per Premises.\n   - Since no manager is a remote worker and James isn’t appearing today unless he's a manager, we conclude that if James appears today, then he’s not a remote employee.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion follows logically from these premises:\n\nIf James is either a manager or in other countries,\n- He must be present at work.\n  - If so (he schedules meetings), he has lunch in company as per premise #2 and hence doesn't eat alone but with clients.

We can write this as \\( L(P, S) \\rightarrow HighlyRanked(P) \\).\n   - Premise 3: All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Swiatek.\n     This means for all female tennis players (let's call her F), if she played in the tournament and is a female player, \\( P(F,RG_{2022}) \\land Female(P) \\rightarrow L(P,I) \\).\n   - Premise 4: Either female or male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022.\n     This means there are some females (\\( F(RG_{2022},Female) \\)) and/or males (\\( M(RG_{2022}) \\)).\n   - Premise 5: All male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal.\n     If a player is male and played in the tournament, \\( P(M,RG_{2022}) \\), then they lost to Rafa.

Given that she isn't a male and considering all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 have played against Iga Swiatek.\n\nThus:\n\nGiven \\( HighlyRanked(CG) \\rightarrow ActiveInMajors(CG) \\), we must check if Coco Gauff is highly ranked, therefore being active in majors.

Let's analyze these statements logically:\n    1. If all cats are mammals, this means there is no such thing as a cat that is not a mammal (since the term 'cat' itself implies it belongs to the category of mammals).\n    2. The second premise tells us some pets are not mammals.\n\n4. Now, if we combine these two premises:\n   - If all cats are mammals and there exists at least one pet that is not a mammal.\n   - It follows logically that \"some\" (or potentially more than just a few) of the non-mammals could be categorized as pets but certainly cannot also fall into the category of cats because no cat can fail to be a mammal.\n\n5.

From point 1 and the fact that Butte is explicitly listed in Montana, we confirm Butte is indeed within Montana.\n\nGiven all these points:\n\n- We know Pierre is not in Montana as per point 3,\n- Therefore, any city named \"Butte\" (which includes Billings) cannot be in the same state with Pierre since they are distinct and Pierre isn’t part of Montana according to point 1.\n\nConclusion:\nTherefore, Butte (and hence cities like Billings which also fall under this context as per other premises if needed for reasoning but not directly stated) is NOT in the same state with Pierre. The conclusion provided that \"Butte and Pierre are in the same state\" would be false based on our gathered information.\n\nAnswer: False",

We start with the given premises:\n   - All growth stocks of companies are volatile.\n     (P → Q)\n   - If a stock price is volatile, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund.\n     (~Q ∧ ¬R) ⇒ ~S\n   - Some stocks of some companies are growth stocks of companies. This implies that there exists at least one company with such stocks.\n     (∃x)(G(x))\n   - All stocks of mature companies are suitable for a retirement fund.\n     M(x) → S(x)\n   - KO is a stock of a mature company.\n     KOM\n\n2. Let's analyze the conclusion:\n   \"If KO is a growth stock of a company or if its price is volatile, then KO is neither a stock of a company nor is its price volatile.\"\n   This can be represented in logical form as: (G(K) ∨ V(K)) ⇒ ¬KOM.\n\n3. We know from the premises:\n   - If G(x), then x is volatile.\n     (P → Q)\n   - KOM means KO is a stock of a mature company, so it must be suitable for retirement fund by definition since all stocks of mature companies are suitable for retirement funds.\n     M(K) ⊢ S(K)\n\n4. The conclusion states that if G(K) or V(K), then ¬KOM (KO isn’t a stock nor is its price volatile). However, given KO is already established as a stock of a mature company:\n   - If KO were to be growth stock and thus also have the property of being volatile,\n     Then we would derive that it cannot be a suitable retirement fund stock.\n\n5. Since KOM holds true (KO is indeed a stock of a mature company), no condition can change this fact unless there was an error in our premises or conclusion setup itself.\n   - However, the given statement doesn’t negate the existing facts about KO but instead implies something else entirely if it’s volatile and/or growth.\n\n6. Therefore, the logical contradiction arises due to trying to fit a new property that isn't directly contradictory but rather non-applicable based on our premises:\n     (G(K) ∨ V(K)) ⇒ ¬KOM is false since KOM remains true regardless of G or V properties.\n\nConclusion: The final answer is B - False.",

The conditional statement given in premises is:\n   - \"If dried Thai chilies are spicy or a bakery, then dried Thai chilies are a hotpot or are spicy.\"\n     Since we have established that no cupcake can be spicy (and thus also not any product from Baked by Melissa), and since all products of Baked by Melissa are cupcakes:\n   - Dried Thai chilies cannot be both \"spicy\" or \"a bakery\".\n\n4.

This contradicts the conclusion that Subway receives \"many\" negative reviews.\n     - Thus, if Subway is popular among local residents (having a high rating), this also implies its presence on Yelp's recommendation list by premise 5.\n\n   Since both possibilities lead to contradictions with receiving many negative reviews:\n      If it has a high rating or is very popular, then per premises, Subway cannot receive \"many\" negative reviews. Therefore, if the conclusion says that Subway receives \"many\" negative reviews and provides take-out service simultaneously (which contradicts premise 4), there's an inherent contradiction.\n\n   Conclusion: This logical inconsistency suggests that such a situation where Subway has high ratings or is popular but still receives many negative reviews cannot be true.

Fluffy is Tom's cat and cats are pets; therefore, Fluffy can be considered a pet for this context.\n3. The Olive Garden is stated to be a managed building (Premise [BG]).\n4. If Tom rents an apartment in the Olive Garden and wants to move with his cat (Fluffy), he must adhere to two conditions:\n   - He needs to ensure that Fluffy, as a pet, would be allowed.\n5. From these points, we infer that since pets are generally allowed in some managed buildings, including The Olive Garden allows Tom's cat if the other conditions permit it.\n\nConclusion:\nGiven all premises and considering the logic provided, Tom will rent an apartment at the Olive Garden only if the security deposit is no more than $1500. Since 2000$ (the monthly rent) is indeed greater than $1500$, this condition would not be met under normal circumstances.\n\nAnswer:\nThe final answer is False.\n```",

Also, we know that \"All monkeys are mammals.\" Therefore, it follows logically that all monkeys are also animals.\n3. The problem states: \"An animal is either a monkey or a bird.\"\n4. Given the premises and conclusion about Rock not having wings (and thus neither flying nor breathing), let's analyze if Rock can be classified as an animal.\n\n    - If Rock were a bird, it would fly according to premise 6.\n    - Since we are told that \"Rock is neither a fly nor a bird,\" this means Rock cannot fly or breathe because all birds fly and animals (including those that don't fly) breathe.\n\n5. From the statement: \"If something can fly, then it has wings.\" If Rock doesn’t have wings and can’t fly, we must conclude:\n    - Since flying implies having wings, not being able to fly means no need for wings.\n6. We also know from premise 7 that if a thing does not fly (and is neither bird nor fly), it does not breathe.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- If Rock were an animal but was neither a monkey or a bird:\n    - It would contradict the statements about Rock being able to breath and fly, which it can't.\n    - Hence we conclude from premises that if Rock fits none of these categories (monkey/bird/animal) as per premise 3.\n\nConclusion:\n\n- Since all birds breathe, and given rock doesn’t fit any animal category due to not flying or breathing:\nRock is neither a monkey nor bird. Thus it's an entity outside the specified animals in this context.\nSo Rock does not have wings because it’s neither a fly (which has wings) nor a bird.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is True",

From these two premises, we can infer that anyone traveling to Paris for their honeymoon must have children.\n5.

The fourth statement says if John has at least one child, he does neither have a wedding nor travels to Paris (Premise 5).\n7. We need to analyze the fifth premise which states that: If John's wedding is well-attended then either it’s in July or else he must travel to Paris for their honeymoon.\n\n8. Let us evaluate if John has any wedding, especially a well-attended one.\n    - If there are some weddings in July and they're well attended (Premise 6), we need to check with the fifth premise which says either it’s his or he travels to Paris.\n    - Given that all people who have weddings must be those having at least one child, John doesn't qualify for this as per Premise 5.\n\n9. Thus from these premises and their logical combinations:\n   - If John has children (as assumed by the first part of fifth premise), he neither travels nor attends wedding.\n   - But if his well-attended wedding is in July or else Paris, contradicting that he doesn't have a child.\n\n10.

Finally, it is stated that some animals to be bred-back resemble animals that are extinct.\n\nBased on this information:\n- The statement that some animals to be bred back resemble animals that are extinct implies that there must have been an initial population of those animals (aurochs) from which they were derived.\n- If aurochs existed in the 1920s and Heck cattle were deliberately created to resemble them, it suggests that at least a remnant or genetic material of aurochs still survived into the early 20th century.\n\nConclusion:\nSince the breeding back process implies an existing population from which new animals are derived (in this case, to create Heck cattle), and given that both Heck cattle and their prototype species share common traits with extinct creatures, it is logical to infer that aurochs were not entirely extinct by the 1920s.

Neapolitan Chronicles is a book published by New Vessel Press and was translated from Italian.\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n4. Since all of their books are in English and Neapolitan Chronicles was translated into English, it implies that the original language must have been non-English.\n5. Given that Neapolitan Chronicles is a specific instance where an Italian book was translated to English by New Vessel Press, this suggests a pattern: foreign literature (like Italian) being published in English.\n\n6. We are also given that Palace of Flies is another book published by the same publisher, and since all books from New Vessel Press follow their specialty pattern:\n7. It follows logically that if Neapolitan Chronicles was translated into English from Italian, then other books like \"Palace of Flies\" would likely have been similarly translated.\n\nConclusion: Based on this reasoning, we conclude that Palace of Flies must also have been translated from a foreign language (since New Vessel Press specializes in such translations and they follow the pattern shown with Neapolitan Chronicles).\n\nAnswer:\nThe final answer is A) True.",

The conclusion states that Remy has a fully stocked and impressive home office.\n   - According to the given premises, if someone owns a large desktop monitor at their home (P2), then they have a fully stocked and impressive home office (because P3 says all people who own such monitors also have this type of an office).\n     Therefore, Remy must either:\n       * Own a large desktop monitor or\n       * Not own one.\n\n2. The conclusion states that Remy visits the office supply store regularly.\n   - According to premise P4, if someone spends their free time tidying and organizing spaces in their home (T), then they do not go to bed late and wake up after noon (N).\n     If we consider both scenarios for Remy:\n       * Scenario 1: Remy goes to bed late and wakes up every day after noon.\n         - This scenario contradicts P4, which says that someone who spends their free time tidying does not go to bed late. So, this is impossible.\n\n       * Scenario 2: Remy neither goes to bed late nor wakes up after noon (N), meaning they do spend their free time tidying and organizing spaces in their home.\n         - This scenario fits the conditions of P4 but also means that if someone spends their free time on these activities, then by definition, they visit the office supply store regularly.\n\n3. Since Scenario 1 is impossible based on given premises (Remy cannot both go to bed late/wake up after noon and spend free time tidying), Remy must fit in Scenario 2:\n   - In this scenario, Remy neither goes to bed late nor wakes up after noon.\n     - This means they do not own a large desktop monitor at their home (since P1 states that if you go to bed late/wake up after noon and spend free time tidying, then you can't have such monitors).\n       - If no large desktop monitor is owned by Remy, it also implies there cannot be a fully stocked impressive home office.\n\n4. Therefore, the conclusion derived from these steps indicates that if we assume Remy fits in Scenario 2 (they do not go to bed late and wake up after noon), they must either:\n   - Have no large desktop monitor.\n   - Not have a fully stocked home office as stated by P3.\n     Hence, it is impossible for Remy to visit the office supply store regularly if these conditions hold.\n\nConclusion: Based on this step-by-step reasoning, we conclude that the statement \"Remy has a fully stocked and impressive home office and also visits the office supply store regularly\" cannot be true given our assumptions.

Since his wanting is combined with his ability (accessing the program which means he can compose) per the third premise:\n- \"George wants to compose\" + \"He can compose\" = \"Therefore, George will actually compose\".\n\nSo based on our premises and logical flow:\n\nConclusion: If George likes music and has access to a program, he will indeed compose.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is A) True",

Now, since Taylor did not grow up in a health-conscious home:\n   - She does not eat salads regularly based on premises 1 and 2 (people who do not fit this criteria don't consume salads).\n\nConclusion: The final answer is B) False.\nTaylor does **not** eat salads regularly.",

Furthermore, the statement \"If someone wears large shoes, then they wear large-sized clothes\" implies that since Yuri wears large shoes (from step 3), he should also wear large-size clothes.\n5. However, we are given directly in the problem statement that \"Yuri does not wear large-size clothes.\"\n6.

From premise 1 and 3, we know that there exists at least one non-American basketball player who is also tall because some are not American.\n\n3. From premises 4 and the fact that Yuri does not wear large-size clothes:\n   - Since if someone wears large shoes they must wear large-sized clothes (L → C), and Yuri doesn't wear large-sized clothes, we can conclude by contrapositive reasoning that Yuri cannot be wearing large shoes.\n     Thus: ¬C ⇒ ¬L\n4. Now apply the contrapositive of premise 2:\n   - If someone is tall then they must not wear small sized clothes (¬T → C) because if T, L and L implies C.\n5. Since we know that Yuri does not wear large-sized clothes (C), from step 3 conclusion ¬L applies to him.\n\n6. Using the contrapositive of premise 2:\n   - If someone is tall then they must be wearing large shoes or else are small sized clothes, since ¬T implies C.\n7. We have already established that Yuri does not wear large-sized clothes (C), hence we can conclude from step 3 and 6 that Yuri cannot be tall.\n\n8. Since all basketball players are supposed to be tall but Yuri is not, he must therefore fit the condition of being a non-basketball player.\n\n9. However since premise states \"Yuri does not wear large-size clothes,\" which implies contradiction with other premises unless it's specifically mentioned about him.\n10. Therefore based on contrapositive reasoning if someone is American then they are basketball players and we have already concluded that Yuri cannot be tall, so he must fit the condition of being an American.\n\nConclusion: The conclusion \"If Yuri does not wear large shoes, then Yuri is an American basketball player\" holds true because:\n- Since Yuri doesn't wear large-sized clothes (C), it means he can either wears small size or medium.\n  - If he was a tall person that implies he would wear larger sizes as per premises given but since he's not wearing them it means he cannot be considered to fit in the basketball player category.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is A) True.",
