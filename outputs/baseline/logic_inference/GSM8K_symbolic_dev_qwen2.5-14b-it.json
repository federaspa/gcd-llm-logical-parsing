Since each die roll is independent, the probability that both rolls are odd (two consecutive events):\n   - \\(P(A and B)= P(A)*P(B)\\)\n   - So for two successive odd numbers: \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2} * \\frac{1}{2}\\right) =\\frac{1}{4}=0.25\\) or 25%.\n\n4. Finally, to determine how much more likely it is that he rolls a number greater than 10 compared with rolling two odd numbers in succession:\n   - We have the probability for \"greater than 10\" as \\(P(>10) = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n   - And we've calculated above, P(two consecutive odds)=\\(\\frac{1}{4}.\\)\n   \n5. Now calculate how much greater one is compared to another:\n   - Let's use the formula for relative probability: \\(P(> 10)/P(consecutive \\ odd) = (\\frac{\\text{Probability of rolling a number >10}}{\\text{ Probability of two consecutive rolls being odd}})\\).\n   \n6. Thus, we get :\n\\[Relative\\ likelihood=\\left(\\dfrac{{\\frac{1}{2}}}{{\\frac{1}{4}}}\\right)= 2 \\]\n\n7. Convert this relative probability to a percentage:\n   - \\( Relative \\ Likelihood= (2 * 100)\\%=200%\\)\n\nAnswer: The final answer is **200**",

This can be simplified but we will keep it as is for now since simplifying won't change our method significantly.\n\nThe sum of parts (sugar + water) = 147 + 96.\nTotal amount used by Fatima = 1458 teaspoons and cups combined.\n\nLet's denote the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she uses as \\(S\\) and the number of cups of water she uses as \\(W\\).\n\nFrom the problem, we have:\n\\[ S : W = 147 : 96 \\]\nand\n\\[ S + W = 1458. \\]\n\nTo find how much Fatima used for sugar (\\(S\\)), let's use these proportions.\n\nThe total parts are \\(147+96=243\\) (the sum of the ratio numbers).\n\nSo, each part represents:\n\\[ \\frac{1458}{243} = 6. \\]\n\nThis means that for every unit in the original ratio,\n- sugar is represented by \\(147\\),\nand\n- water is represented by \\(96.\\)\n\nThus, Fatima's usage of sugar can be calculated as:\n\\[ S = 147 \\times 6. \\]\nTherefore:\n\\[ S = 882. \\]\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 882.",

      "raw": " Step by step reasoning:\n1. Calculate the total number of potted plants Yara initially has: she already had 11 pots on each of her 51 window ledges, so \\(11 \\times 51 = 561\\) potted plants.\n2. Add to this initial count the new plants that were delivered last week (38): \n   \\(561 + 38 = 599\\).\n3. Calculate how many she will give away: Yara plans on giving out 6 from each of her ledges, so:\n   \\((6) \\times (51) = 306\\) potted plants.\n4. Subtract the number given away from the total to find what remains:\n    \\(599 - 306 = 293\\).\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 293.",

      "raw": " Step by step reasoning:\n1. We know that Fatima spends 48 minutes walking on the beach.\n2. Let's denote her speed on the beach as \\(v\\) (miles per minute). Since she walks for 48 minutes at this rate, we can express the distance covered while walking on the beach using these values: Distance = Speed * Time -> 12 miles = v * 48 min.\n3. Solving the above equation gives us Fatima's speed \\(v\\) as follows:\n\\[ v = \\frac{12}{48} = \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ mile per minute}\\]\nThis means that her walking rate on the beach is one quarter of a mile every minute.\n4. Since she walks at twice this speed on sidewalks, we calculate \\(v_{sidewalk}= 2 * v = 0.5\\) miles per minute.\n5. We know the total distance Fatima covers while walking on the sidewalk is 13 miles. At her rate of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) mile every minute, it takes:\n\\[ t = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{13\\,\\text{miles}}{0.5\\,\\text{mile per min}}= 26\\,\\text{minutes} \\]\nfor Fatima to walk the entire distance on sidewalks.\n6.

We are told that she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk compared to her speed on the beach.\n3. Let's denote the time it takes for Zahra to walk a mile on the beach as \\(t\\) (in hours). Therefore, in one hour, Zahra can cover \\(\\frac{1}{t}\\) miles of beach walking distance.\n4. Since she spends 60 minutes or 1 hour (\\(60 / 60 = 1\\)) on the beach and covers 15 miles during this time, we find that \\(t\\) is also equal to one hour per mile because \\(\\frac{1}{t} * t = 1\\) (hour/mile).\n5. Consequently, Zahra can cover twice as much distance in an hour while walking on the sidewalk since her speed doubles.\n6. To walk 15 miles at double the beach rate (\\(2/t\\)), it would take \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) hours or \\(30\\) minutes (since she covers two miles per hour, and thus half of one hour to cover fifteen miles).\n7. Adding together both halves of her journey:\n   - Beach walking time = 60 minutes\n   - Sidewalk walking time = \\(\\frac{1}{2} * 60 = 30\\) minutes (since the speed is twice as much, it takes half the beach's equivalent \"per mile\" time)\n8.

She covers 14 kilometers in total on sidewalks and uses time \\(\\frac{distance}{speed}\\). The distance walked on the beach can be calculated as:\n   - Distance = Speed * Time\n     \\(11\\) km (beach) = \\(v\\)*\\(66\\) min, solving for v gives us: \n   \\(v = 11/66 = \\frac{1}{6}\\text{km/min.} Therefore her speed on the sidewalk is three times that of beach which means:\n     - Speed on Sidewalk (Ss) = 3 * (\\(\\frac{1}{6}\\)) km/min\n       \\(= \\frac{1/2\\)}\\) km/min.\n4.

    "logic_problem": {
      "raw": "\nStep by step reasoning:\n1. First, let's calculate the cost of 22 kgs of cotton candy.\n   - The store offers a deal where \"Buy 15 kgs at ₣21 per kg, get 5 kgs 2/3 off.\"\n   \n   For simplicity, we can break this down into two parts:\n   - First part: She buys the first 15kg of cotton candy.\n     \\[ \n       Cost = 15\\text{ kg} \\times ₣21/\\text{kg} = ₳315\n     \\]\n\n   - Second part: For each additional kilogram beyond those initial fifteen, she gets a discount on the next five kilograms. Since she bought an extra seven (i.e., 22-15) kgs of cotton candy:\n     \n     The cost for these additional 7 kg should be calculated as follows:\n\n     \\[\n       Cost = 7\\text{ kg} \\times ₳(21 - \\frac{2}{3}\\times21)/kg\n             = 7\\text{ kg} \\times (21-\\frac{42}{3})/kg \n             = 7\\text{ kg} \\times (\\frac{63-42)}{3}/kg)\n             = 7\\text{ kg} \\times ₳(21 - 14)/\\text{kg}\n             = 7\\text{ kg} \\times ₣7/\\text{kg}\n             = ₳49\n     \\]\n\n   Therefore, the total cost of cotton candy is:\n   \n    \\[\n       Cost_{total}=Cost_1 + Cost_2 \n                   = ₳315+₳49=₳364\n     \\]\n    \n2. Now let's calculate the additional costs for coral pieces and pins.\n   - Coral pieces: ₣11.75\n   \n   - Pins:\n   \n    Each pin cost is ₾21.25, so for 17 pins,\n  \n    Total Cost of Pins = \\(17 \\times ₳21.25\\) \n                        = \\(17 \\times (21 +0.25)\\) \n                        = \\(364 + 4.25\\)\n                        =₳368.25\n\n   Therefore, the total cost for coral pieces and pins is:\n   \n    Total Cost of Coral Pieces & Pins = ₣(11.75+368.25) \n = ₳380\n   \n3. Adding all these costs together:\n\nTotal Expenses: \\(₳ 364 +₳ 380\\)  \n               = \\(₳ (364 + 380)\\)\n               = \\(₳744\\)\n\nSubtracting total expenses from initial amount:\nInitial Amount - Total Expense\n= ₣1300-₳744 \n= ₦556\n\nAnswer: The final answer is **556**",

      "raw": " Step by step reasoning:\n1. Calculate the price of the more expensive brand of rice.\n   - The normal price is $20 per kg, and it's 20% more expensive now.\n   - New Price = Original Price + (Original Price * Increase Percentage)\n               = $20 + ($20 * 20/100) \n               = $20 + $4\n               = $24/kg\n\n2. Calculate the total amount of rice Arjun needs for a week.\n   - He uses 2 kg per day, so in one week (7 days), he would need:\n     Total Rice Needed = Daily Consumption * Number of Days \n                        = 2 kg/day * 7 days\n                        = 14 kg\n\n3. Calculate the total cost of rice for one week.\n   - Cost of Rice = Price Per Kg * Amount Of Rice In Kgs\n                  = $24/kg * 14 kg\n                  = $336\n\n4. Add in the cookie that Arjun decided to buy, which costs him an additional dollar.\n\n5. Calculate total cost by adding both rice and cookies.\n   - Total Cost = Cost of Rice + Price Of Cookie \n                 = $336 + $1 \n                 = $337\nAnswer: The final answer is 337",

Tariq then finds eight times as many eggs as Roya did (which was 5).\n   - Therefore, \\(Tariq\\)'s find: \\(8 \\times 5 = 40\\)\n\n4. Liam finds two less than what Tariq found:\n   - Thus, \\(Liam\\)'s find: \\(40 - 2 = 38\\)\n   \n5.

Rounding this value to the nearest dollar gives us ₺4 since again we are rounding based on whether or not the decimal portion is greater than .5 and here, being over that threshold means it rounds up from 3.\n4. The price for roses is ₺4.85 per bouquet.

First, calculate the number of days Umar works in June.\n   - Since not all months have exactly 4 weeks and some start on different weekdays than others do, we need to know how many working days there are specifically in a given month for accurate calculations. However, without specific information about which day each week starts (e.g., the first of the month being Monday or Wednesday), it's common practice to assume an average work schedule that aligns with 4 full weeks plus any extra days.\n   - June has 30 days and if we assume a typical scenario where Umar works every weekday, this would mean he potentially could have worked for one additional day beyond the normal four-week cycle (since April through September can fit exactly five working week schedules).\n   \n2. Calculate how many full weeks of work are in June:\n   - 4 complete weeks = 4 * 5 days per week = 20 weekdays.\n  \n3. Assuming Umar works every weekday, calculate any extra day(s) beyond the four-week cycle for this specific month (June):\n   - If we take a general approach and assume that there could be an additional working day in June due to its length:\n     - This would mean potentially one more full workweek's worth of days plus 4 additional days (as each week starts anew).\n   \nThus, taking into account the assumption for simplicity, Umar works approximately \\(25\\) weekdays this month.\n\n4.

Calculate the number of working days in October.\n   - Assuming a standard work week (Monday to Thursday), we need to count how many such weeks fit into an average 31-day month for October, plus any extra days if applicable.\n\n2. Since there is no specific mention that Theo does not work on certain Fridays or weekends during the specified period, let's assume he works Monday through Thursday every week.\n   - A standard month like October has about 4 full weeks (each with a working day count of 4), which totals to \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) days.\n\n3. Calculate Theo’s earnings from hourly wages:\n   - He earns €15 per hour and works for 10 hours each workday.\n     So, daily wage is: \\(€15/hour \\times 10\\;hours/day = €150/day\\).\n\n4. Multiply the daily wage by the total number of working days in October:\n   - Total earnings from hourly wages are therefore: \\(€150/day \\times 16\\;days = €2,400\\).\n\n5. Calculate Theo’s weekly bonus and then for a month.\n   - He gets a €482 bonus each week the company performs well.\n\n6.

      "raw": " Step by step reasoning:\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the total missed income if Valentina does her accounting herself and then compare that with hiring a financial advisor.\n\n1. Calculate how much money is lost per hour of consulting work: €57/hour.\n2. Determine the number of hours she will miss due to doing accounting by herself (7 fewer hours).\n3. Multiply these two values together to find out total missed income if she does it herself:\n   Missed Income = 7 hours * €57/hour\n4. The cost for hiring a financial advisor is given as: €195.\n5. Now, we calculate the difference in money spent or lost between doing her own accounting and paying someone else to do it.\n\nLet's start with step three:\n   Missed Income = 7 * €57/hour\n                  = 399 euros\n\nNow for step five: Calculate how much more money she will have by hiring a financial advisor.\nMoney saved or extra income from not doing the accounting herself and instead paying someone else is equal to her missed consulting work minus the cost of employing an accountant.\n\n   Extra Income (or Money Saved) = Missed Consulting Work - Cost\n = 399 euros - €195\n\nFinally, perform this subtraction:\n   \n   Answer: The final answer is 204",

To find out how many days he works in a year multiply total working days in one month by the number of months in a year: \\((4*2) *12\\).\n6. Finally to calculate his annual salary we need to know what he earns per day which is given as ₺140.\n7. Multiply the daily pay (step 6) with total working days for one month calculated above(step 5): \\(140*(4*2)*12\\).\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 13440",

When Arash first saw the comet again (the second time), he was four times as old as his uncle was during their respective sightings of the Comet.\n\nLet \\(x\\) be the number of years between the two sightings, which is also a multiple of 80 because that's how often this particular comet appears.\n4. We know from point 3 above:\n\\[ \\text{Age of Arash when he saw it second time} = 21*4 = 84\\]\n5. Since the period between seeing Comet Hyakutake is exactly once every 80 years, we can find out how many years passed since his uncle's sighting until Arash first sighted again:\n\\[ \\text{Age of Arash when he saw it second time} - (\\text{age at which his Uncle saw}) = x\\]\n6. Plugging in the values from step 4 and point 2 above, we get:\n\\[84 - 21 = 63 \\]\n\nSince \\(x\\) must be a multiple of 80 (the orbital period), this means Arash first sighted Comet Hyakutake when his age was such that it fit the periodicity correctly. Therefore,\n7. We calculate how old he would have been:\n\\[ x = 80\\text{ years} \\]\nTherefore, if \\(63\\) is not a multiple of the period and we must find an earlier sighting for Arash (i.e., before his uncle's), then logically it was at least one full cycle back. Thus,\n\\[x - 80 +21 = age\\]\n\nSo:\n\\[Age when first saw comet= 63-80+21=-4 \\rightarrow must be previous period fit correct so 21-(previous time) ->fit is then: \n[correct calculation]\n=> Arash's Age was => [age at uncle] - (time before cycle full): \n\nSo:\n\\[Arash first saw it when he was : age = 21-80+63=4 \\]\n\nAnswer: The final answer is \\(4\\).",

For sake of completion:\n   - Let's hypothetically assume (for calculation purpose only) average weight as an arithmetic mean based on provided data which might not reflect actual total accurately.\n\n3. Calculate the hypothetical total weight using available weights and dividing by 7 for simplification if assuming equal distribution isn't valid then we have insufficient info.\n4.

Determine how much extra learning time he spends each Saturday and Sunday:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2}{3} \\, (\\text{i.e., five-sixths of his weekly minutes}) = 1890 \\times \\left( \\frac{5/6 + 5/6}{7}\\right) / (6+2)\n= \\frac{\\frac {10}{6}} {\\frac{8}{3}}\n\\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Extra time each day} = 1890 \\times \\frac{5/6}{4}\n                                = 1890 * (\\frac{5}{24})\n                                = 1890 / (7) * ((5)/3)\n                                = 1890 * .68\n\\]\n\n\\[= 1890* \\left(\\frac {5/6 + 5/6} {(6+2)}\\right)\\]\n   - He spends five-sixths of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.\n   \n4. Calculate the extra learning time per day:\n\n\\[ \\text{Extra learning time/day (in hours)} = \n(1890 * (\\frac {5}{12})) / 60\n= ((315*5)/7) /60\n\\]\n\n5. Convert this to total weekly minutes for Saturday and Sunday:\n   \n   - This means he spends \\( \\left(\\text{Total Weekly Minutes}*\\frac{(5/6+5/6)}(8)\\right)\n     = (total * 12.49)\n\n\\[= ((315*5)/7) / 60\\]\n    \nSo:\n\n\\[ (\\frac {315}{7}) \\times \\left(\\frac{5 + 5} {(6+2)}}\\right) \n/60\n\\]\n\n6\\. Convert total time spent in minutes to hours for the week:\n   \n   - Total class and extra learning weekly = (class min per day * days a week)\n\n\\[= ((1890*7)) / 30 \\]\n    \nThus,\n\nFinal calculation:\n\nTotal Weekly Learning Time: \\(24\\) Hours\n\nAnswer: The final answer is \\(24\\).",

      "raw": " Step by step reasoning:\n1. First, calculate the total number of people at the beginning: 63 nurses + 63 engineers = 126 people.\n2. After 45 minutes, half of these individuals left, meaning (1/2) * 126 = 63 people departed from the conference.\n3. This implies that there are now only 63 - x remaining at the venue where 'x' is the number who have stayed behind; but we know a specific subset: specifically it's mentioned 22 nurses remained, so these plus any engineers left constitute this reduced count of attendees post-departure.\n4. Given 22 out of the initial group of 63 nurses are staying, that means (63 - 22) = 41 nurses have departed.\n5. Since a total of 63 people had to leave and we know how many were nurses who left, then by deduction: remaining engineers + those nurses still there must be the other half minus those departing nurses calculated above leaving behind only their colleagues (the engineers).\n6. So if initially all present added up as noted before halving when some departed, we have 63 - 22 = 41 who left being specifically known to comprise solely of nurse departures.\n7. Therefore the number remaining would be half originally gathered minus those departing nurses already accounted for leaving behind only their colleagues (engineers) thus: 63 total staying after departure split between specified 22 and others engineers, hence:\n8. The count of engineer attendees who stayed is therefore simply: 63 - 22 = 41.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 41",

Calculate the total time Valeria takes to swim two miles on a hot day (warm water).\n   - For each mile, it is 31 minutes so for two miles: \\(2 \\times 31 = 62\\) minutes.\n   \n3. Determine how long Valeria would take if swimming in cold water:\n   - It's given as 14 minutes per mile thus, for two miles on a cold day: \\(2 \\times 14 = 28\\) minutes.\n\n4. Calculate the difference between these times to find out much longer it takes her when she swims on a hot (warm) versus a cold day.\n   - The time difference is given by subtracting the cold water swim time from warm water swim time: \\(62 - 28 = 34\\) minutes.\n\nAnswer:\nThe final answer is 34.",

In cold water: The problem states that a kilometer is swum in 22 minutes when the water is cold.\n3. In warm water: It's given as \"6 minutes more than two times\" (of the time taken on a cold day). So, we calculate this by first doubling the cold-water swimming time and then adding six minutes:\n   - Double of cold-day swim = 2 * 22\n   - Additional time in hot weather = +6\n4. Calculate total warm water swimming time: \n   \\( (2 \\times 22) + 6 \\)\n5. Now we can compute the difference for one kilometer between a cold day and a hot day.\n6.
