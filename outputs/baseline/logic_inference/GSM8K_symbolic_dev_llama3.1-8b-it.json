      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's analyze the situation where Santiago rolls a number greater than 10 on his 20-sided die.\n   There are 20 possible outcomes when rolling this type of die (from 1 to 20).\n   Numbers from 11 to 20 will be considered as numbers greater than 10: that makes 10 favorable outcomes.\n\n2. Next, let's analyze the situation where Santiago rolls two odd numbers in a row.\n   To start with, there are four possible odd numbers on each side of the die (1,3,5 and 7).\n   Therefore, when rolling two consecutive times, we get 4*4 = 16 favorable outcomes.\n\n3. Now that both situations have been analyzed separately, let's calculate their probabilities.\n   The probability for a number greater than 10 is calculated as: \n      Number of favorable outcomes / Total possible outcomes\n   This becomes (10/20) which simplifies to (1/2).\n   \n4. Similarly the probability rolling two odd numbers in row will be:\n    Favorable outcome from above /Total possible outcomes.\n   That turns out to 16/(total number of ways a dice can roll twice), \n   or equivalently, it equals 16/400.\n\n5. The next step is find how much more likely one event (a greater than ten) occurs compared to another event\n    We do this by finding the difference between their probabilities and converting that into percentage.\n    So we take a probability of rolling greater number than 10 from above \n     which equals 0.50 - Probability for two odd numbers in row = 16/400 or equivalently (1/25) ≈ .04\n   The resulting answer, when converted to the required format is calculated as follows: ((0.5-0.04)*100).\n\nAnswer: The final answer is $\\boxed{46}$.",

This is done by adding 23 (video game players) and 41 (volleyball enthusiasts), which equals 64.\n2. Since there are a total of 157 students in this group, we need to subtract the ones that already have their hobbies chosen from these options. So, let's find out how many like either hike or paint by doing: \n   Total number of students - (Number who play video games + Number who play volleyball) =  \n   157 - 64 = 93.\n3. Now we know there are a total of 93 that prefer to do something between hiking and painting, but the question only asks for those people that like 'hiking'. We have been given information stating \"the number that like to paint is twice the number that prefer playing volleyball\". Since it's known they all either hike or paint (not both), if we know how many of each group there are then 93 will be equal to: \n   Number who prefer hiking + Twice the number who play Volleyball.\n4. Let x = The total amount people in this scenario like volley ball, so\n   x *2 is equivalent for 'the twice that volleyball players', or \"twice the number that prefer playing volleyball\" since it was specified as such above \n5. With this information we can solve the equation by using the following:  \n   Number who hike + (x* 2) =93.\n6. The total amount of people in a group is x, therefore if there are two groups then:\n   number hiking+number painting= 93\n7. It also says that 'the rest like to either hike or paint.' So the \"rest\" means: \n8. There will be as many people doing one thing and another, but not both (like in this case), so it is stated by previous knowledge about groups.\n9. The amount of hiking enthusiasts can now be found from:\n   93 - x *2 = number that prefer to hike\n10. Given the statement \"the rest like to either hike or paint\", we know there are only two options here, therefore: \n    This makes us able to solve this problem because if there is a total of 41 who enjoy volleyball and they double it up (i.e., x *2), then that would equal to people painting.\n11. If all the groups were known except for 'number hiking' in these three scenarios, we could find out how many students like hiking by solving this equation:\n    Number who prefer playing Volleyball + Twice the number of volleyball enthusiasts = Total amount who hike or paint\n12. Since it has been found that there are 41 players participating in volley ball then \n13. If you substitute x with a value (in other words, plug-in) for an answer to this problem:\n    x *2 + Number hiking =93.\n14. By taking into account all the prior knowledge from previous steps, we can find out how many students like 'hiking' by plugging 41 in as \"x\" which is equal to volleyball enthusiasts and solving it using algebraic reasoning\n15. This would be:\n   (41*2)+number hiking=93\n16. The solution for this equation will give the answer of how many people participate in activities related to 'hiking'\n17.

We need to find out how many students have a hobby other than playing music or cricket (i.e., video games or dance).\n4. This is calculated by subtracting the sum of those who play music and cricket from the total: \n   Total - Music - Cricket = Students with remaining hobbies\n5. 155 - 35 - 14 = 106 students have a hobby other than playing music or cricket.\n6. The problem states that twice as many like to dance compared to cricket, so we can let 'x' be the number of people who play cricket and then double it for those dancing: \n   Cricket (C) = x\n   Dance (D) = 2 * C = 2 * x\n   \n7. Since there are only two groups remaining after removing music & cricket from total students, we can set up an equation with 'x' as the variable:\n    Students who like video games or dance + People playing Cricket and dancing = Total - Music\n   Then: \n       Dance (D) + Cricket(C)  = Video Games(VG) + D+ C\n   \n   Let's substitute our expressions for cricket & dance in terms of x, into this equation above.\n   \n    VG = Students with remaining hobbies after removing music&cricket from total students. So:\n      2x+x=106\n8. Combining the like terms on left side yields: \n     3x = 106\n    \n9. Dividing both sides by three gives us 'x', i.e., those who prefer cricket.\n    x = (3 * VG) / (D+ C)\n   We know now that D +C=2x, from our prior steps:\n    x=(VG*3)/(2*x)= 106/3\n   \n10.

Then in the next 30 seconds (total of 60 seconds), 2 times that amount popped so 80 x 2 = 160 kernels popped in this period.\n3. The total number of kernels popped up to now is: \n   - First 30 seconds: 80\n   - Next 30 seconds: 160\n   Total popping till the end of second set of 30 seconds (at a rate twice as fast) is, therefore:\n   - 80 + 160 = 240\n\n4. In the next period, they pop at four times that amount in each 30-second block so for this time frame: \n    - Popping rate increased by factor of 4 over previous\n    So number popped in third set is (initial popping * 2) x 4:\n        Initial was a 80 kernels and doubled to 160 then quadrupled the new base to get 640.\n5. The total number of kernels popped up till now, including this period: \n   - Previous popping: 240\n   New rate for third set (the 30 seconds with increased rate): 640\n6. Total so far is previous + latest:\n    240+640 = 880\n\n7. In the next 30 seconds, the kernels pop at half that rate compared to before.\n8. Half of this period's popping rate would be: \n   - (previous set) /2 : So number popped in fourth and final set was\n     half of what we have for last block which is half of (initial *4).\n    Since initial 30 seconds gave a count of kernels as 80,\n    then doubling that to get the next rate results in: \n        - Initial doubled = 160.\n   So, halved from quadrupled base would be:\n      Quadruple the popped number at end of second set (which was initially doubled) /2\n     Therefore half is calculated by taking this value and dividing it by two so we have a popping rate as follows: \n        - Halving the 640 gives us our answer in next block which equals to 320\n\n9. The total number of kernels popped up till now, including this period:\n    Total previous (till third set) + latest (last one): \n   - Previous : 880\n   New rate for fourth set: 320.\n10. Now we calculate the new total popping by adding both counts together to get final answer in terms of total number popped up till now so far as follows:\n    Total = previous+latest= 880 + 320\n\n11. We have been told that after taking pan off heat, a quarter of kernels from last set pop due to residual heating.\n12. From the fourth and latest popping period (which is also final), we had: \n   - Number popped in this time frame as was calculated previously which equals 320.\n\n13. A quarter of those would be:\n    This can now be easily done by dividing that number, found earlier for last set or block by a factor of four to find the answer.\n14. Since (a/4) represents one fourth times value 'a', we have here \n   - (the popping in this time frame)/ 4\n     = 320 / 4 \n\n15. Calculating that will give us: \n    Residual popped kernels, so final is total till now + residual:\n16. The answer to our question about how many pieces of popcorn does Santiago eat can be calculated as follows and must take into account both the popping during heat application in terms of four different 30-second intervals for this particular scenario with additional number from post heating too.\n17. To calculate that, we need add up total popped so far: \n    - Till now (from previous sets): Total till now is 880 +320 =1200\n   - Plus the final count after removing a quarter of what was in last block due to heat transfer which gives us our answer for this part as follows:\n     To find that, we need divide by four.\n18. Final calculation can be done like so: \n    First, calculate how many popped at end from residual heating and add up both totals (during cooking + post heating) together.\n\n19. We have calculated the total till now to get 1200 for all popping before removing a quarter of what was left in last block.\n20. A fourth of kernels that were left would be:\n    - Total popped during heat application /4: \n   Which is equal to\n     - (320)/4\n\n21. The final count, including both totals from previous and post heating will then give the total number so we need add them together now in order to get an answer as follows:\n- So that gives us our 1200 + (320/4) for a grand total of kernels popped.\n\n22.

To do that, we divide 1463 by the sum of the parts in the ratio (149 + 60 = 209) since this represents one set of both sugar and water.\n\nLet's calculate: \n(1/209)*1463\n\nThis is equivalent to:\n(1*1463)/209\n= 6973 / 209 \n\n5. Now, we find how many sets of the given ratio (149 for sugar :60 for water) fit into this amount by dividing and multiplying each part separately.\nTo do that: \nwe take the result from step 4 which is approximately equal to 33.32\nSince it's a fraction with only whole numbers in its denominator, we have to multiply both numerator and denominator of our ratio (149/60) by an integer such as this number.\n\nLet's calculate:\n(1*1463)/209 ≈ 33.32\n\nMultiplying the sugar part by this amount gives us: \n149 * 33 = 4917 \n\n6. Therefore, Leilani used approximately 4917 teaspoonfuls of sugar in her coffee mixture.\nAnswer: The final answer is 4917",

We are told that a total of 1332 teaspoons (sugar + water) were used.\n3. Let's first find the common multiplier for both numbers in the ratio by finding their greatest common divisor. \n   The greatest common divisor between 128 and 20 is 4, so we can multiply each number in the ratio by 4 to get a total of 512 (sugar) + 80 (water).\n4. However since this doesn't equal our known sum of teaspoons used which was stated as being 1332; let's instead use both parts of that equation directly and divide it out.\n   Let s be the number of sugar teaspoons, w = the water cups then we have:\n   (s / 128) : (w / 20) = 1:0.1556\n5. This isn't super useful as is so instead let's get rid of decimals by multiplying each part of our ratio by 100 to make it easier.\n   Now, the ratio becomes s/12,800 : w/2000 and since we have (s+w)/1332 = \n6. We know that the total amount used was 1332 teaspoons so now let's isolate 'w' using substitution:\n    (total - s) / 2000\n7. Now substitute for total: \n   ((1332-s) / 2000)\n8. Next we can use this to solve for 's'. So, the ratio is still that of s/12800 : w/2000.\n9. We set up our equation with these values as (total - s)/w = 1332/w-2000 and simplify it:\n   ((1332-s) / (s/12,800)) = \n10 Then we multiply both sides by the denominator to get rid of that fraction which will look something like this: \n    (1332-s)*12800\n11 Next divide each side by 100 to clean up some clutter and see what we have left.\n   Now it looks more manageable with our equation, let's simplify further:\n12 To do so multiply the whole number out on one side. Multiply 16 * s = (21,331200 -1332*12800) then subtract both sides by this new value to find your answer for 's'.\n    This results in: \n   16*s= 21331200-170060800\n13 So now you can simplify that left-hand side of the equation.\n14 By dividing each term on our right-hand side, we will arrive at an integer number which should represent sugar teaspoons used by Sophia. \n\nAnswer: The final answer is -1551116000",

Multiply these numbers together: \n   First, multiply 43 and 15 to get the total number of apricots Luis has.\n   \n6. Calculate this:\n   43 * 15 = 645\n7. Then, multiply by harvesting frequency which is two times a year.\n8. So now we calculate that as well:\n    Now it's just multiplying one more time: \n     2 * (the total number of apricots Luis has) or 2 * 645.\n\n9. Multiply these numbers together to get our answer\n   The calculation will be this: \n\n10. Calculate the multiplication problem now.\n    So that is equal to:\n    Answer = (43*15)*2",

First, we need to find the total number of grapes in Xavier's field.\n   To do this, we multiply 85 square yards (the size of his grape field) by 34 grapes per square yard.\n\n2. The calculation for this is: \n   Total Grapes = Number of Square Yards * Grapes Per Yard\n   Total Grapes = 85 * 34\n\n3. Next, since Xavier can harvest every two months and there are twelve months in a year, we need to find how many times he can harvest within the year.\n   We calculate this by dividing the total number of grapes available per harvesting session (which is always constant) by the interval between each picking.\n\n4. Since 2 * 6 = 12 (the two intervals add up), Xavier will be able to pick his grape field six times in a single calendar year.\n\n5. Now, we can calculate how many grapes he harvests within that time frame.\n   The calculation for this is:\n   Grapes Harvested per Year = Total Grapes * Number of Times Picked\n   Since total number of grapes remains constant and the interval between picking also does not change; \n   therefore,\n   \n6. We multiply 85 square yards (the size of his grape field) by 34 grapes per yard, then we will get how many he harvests every two months.\n   To calculate this:\n   Total Grapes = Number of Square Yards * Grapes Per Yard\n   Total Grapes = 85 * 34\n\n7.

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n1. Let's denote the number of muffin boxes sold on Tuesday as M_T and pomegranate pie boxes sold on Wednesday as P_W.\n2. Since Jamal sold 19 fewer boxes of pomegranate pie than on Wednesday, we can write an equation: \nP_W - 19 = P_T (where P_T is the number of pomegranate pie boxes sold on Tuesday)\n3. We are given that he sold 14 more boxes of muffins than on Tuesday:\nM_W = M_T + 14\n4. Also, we know that the number of muffin boxes sold on Wednesday was not directly provided but it can be found from the equation (2) and expressed in terms of P_T as follows: \nWe need to first solve for the unknown variable which is the pomegranate pie box sales for Tuesday.\nSo M_W = 24 + 14\n5. After solving equations, we know that:\nP_W - 19 = P_T\nand from equation (2) and given data on Wednesday's muffin boxes \nM_W = 38.\nNow let us determine the value of unknown variable which is pomegranate pie box sales for Tuesday using above information: Since Jamal sold a total of 24 + M_T boxes on Tuesday, it follows that\nP_T = P_W - 19. To find out how many muffins were sold we first have to know what number was the value of pomegranates.\nBut this is only true if he sells (38) boxs in Wednsday. So now using given data \nM_T + M_W must be equal to total sales on Tuesday which will also help us find out how many boxes were sold for both days: \n24  and then the number of pomegranate pie boxes we can calculate as follows.\nP_W = P_T+19\nSo from above equation, let's denote P_W - 19 is M_T +14. We know that:\nM_T + (M_T + 14) should be equal to total muffin sales on Tuesday: \n24 and this means that the value of unknown variable for both days will also help us find out how many boxes were sold in wednsday\nP_W = P_T+19, M_W=M_T+14.\n6. Solving these equations we can now determine:\nM_T + (M_T + 14) is equal to total muffin sales on Tuesday which should be: \n24 and this means that the value of unknown variable for both days will also help us find out how many boxes were sold in wednsday\nP_W = P_T+19, M_W=M_T+14.\n7. From equation (2) we can see that:\nM_W - 38 should be equal to total muffin sales on Tuesday \nwhich is:24 and this means the value of unknown variable for both days will also help us find out how many boxes were sold in wednsday\nP_W = P_T+19, M_W=M_T+14.\n8. Solving equations:\nWe can calculate that Jamal sold 5 muffins on Tuesday (M_T=5).\n9. Therefore,\nJamal's sales of pomegranate pie for Wednesday was: \n24 boxes + 5 \nwhich is equal to 29\n10. Using the above information we know that \nthe total number of boxs which were sold in wednsday must be:\nP_W = P_T+19, M_W=M_T+14.\n11. We can calculate that Jamal's sales on Tuesday was: \n¥ (8 * 5) + ¥(28*4)\n12. Therefore,\nJamal earned for two days:\n¥(40+112)=\nAnswer: The final answer is $152.",

We know that Mohammed sold 18 fewer boxes of orange pie than on Thursday, so the equation for oranges is: OrW = OrTh - 18\n   Also, he sold 13 more boxes of muffin than on Wednesday, so the equation for muffins is: MuW = MuTh + 13 \n3. From the problem statement we know that:\n- On Wednesday: W (Muffin) = 23 and OrW = ? - which can be expressed as a function of Th.\n   So OrW = OrTh - 18\n4. Similarly, on Thursday he sold: MuTh + 13 boxes for muffins and 24 boxes for orange pie:\n- Therefore we have the following equations to solve this problem \n   (1) 23 = W = MuW – 13 or W = MuW – 13 so we can substitute value in equation from point number two\n   And then use our knowledge of algebra, which is that if a=b and c=a+5 ,then c=b+5.\n   Let’s apply this here:\n(2) OrTh -18=OrW \n   \nTo solve for the actual numbers, let's set up an expression using (1). We already know from problem statement that 23 boxes of muffin were sold on Wednesday. Using our knowledge we can substitute value in equation and then use algebra to get result.\n\nSince we have: W = MuTh +13\n   Therefore by substituting the actual number which is given as per question.\n   This comes out to be (MuW -13) \n  Hence, after doing some basic math this results into:\n(1) or value of mu w – 13=23 i.e. muw =36 and now we can easily find that how much orange pie boxes were sold on Wednesday by substituting the known values in equation mentioned at point number (2).\nHence: OrW=OrTh -18 \n    And, OrTh=MuW+13-10\n     Therefore after doing some math it comes out to be 36 + 13 – 10 =39\n\nNow we know that on Wednesday Mohammed sold 23 boxes of muffin and On Thursday he also sold (24) boxes for orange pie. As per problem statement, We can easily find the number of Muffins box by substituting value in equation which is already mentioned at point number one.\nTherefore using our knowledge from step two:\nW = MuTh +13\nHence on Wednesday he sold 36-10=26 muffin boxes and On Thursday he also had (39+18) i.e. total of 57 orange pie box.\n\nNow we know that Mohammed has the following data \n   - He sold: 23 boxes for Muffins and OrW =39 – 18 which is equal to oranges on Wednesday.\n    And, MuTh +13=36 i.e., he also had (26) muffin boxes on Thursday\n     Also On Thursday, total of (24+57) i.e. a total of 81 orange pie box.\n\nNow we can calculate the money that Mohammed earned \n   - Muffins sold = Total number of Muffin * price per Muffin.\n    So, for Wednesday it is: $10*23 and on Thursday: MuTh +13=36 which equals to (26) so he also had 26 muffin boxes. Hence the total money from muffins \n      For two days will be = ($10*$23+$21*(39-18)) i.e., Muffin money is equal to $230+378=$608\n   - Similarly, orange pies sold: Total number of oranges * price per Orange Pie.\n     So for Wednesday he had (39 – 18) and on Thursday we already have value which equals to total of 81 so the actual equation becomes:\n    ($21*(57)) +$10*26 =$1,197+$260=$1457.\n\nNow that we know how many boxes were sold each day and their respective costs \n   - The money he earned can be easily found out by adding both these values. i.e., Total Money Earned = Muffin Money + Orange Pie.\n    Hence the total earnings for two days is equal to ($608+$1457=$2065).\n\nAnswer: $2065",

We know that for each mile walked, time taken is inversely proportional to speed (time = distance / speed).\n4.

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \n\n1. Zahra walks 30 miles every day, with equal distances on the beach and sidewalk (15 miles each).\n2. Let's assume her speed on the beach is x miles per minute.\n3. Since she walks at two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach, her speed on the sidewalk would be 2x miles per minute.\n4. On the beach, Zahra spends 60 minutes walking a total distance of 15 miles. So we can calculate her speed as follows:\n   Speed (on the beach) = Total Distance / Time\n                        = 15 miles / 1 hour \n                        Since there are 60 min in one hour then \n                       = 15/60 or 0.25 mph, now let's convert it into mile per minute.\n                     so we have x=0.25/60 since she walks on the beach at this speed\n5. Now that we know her speed (x), and knowing that her speed is two times faster when walking on the sidewalk then:\n   Speed (on the sidewalk) = 2 * (speed of beach)\n                            = 2 * x \n                            = 0.25*2/60 miles per minute, so this means it takes a fraction for one mile to be covered.\n6. Let's assume t minutes is the time taken by Zahra to cover 15 miles on her sidewalk walk and also let s denote speed of beach in mph\n   Speed (on the sidewalk) = Total Distance / Time \n                           = 15/s *t \n                           Now, we know that it takes two times less when walking on a sidewalk.\n7. So we can write: 2*(speed of beach)*(60/0.25)=s*t or s/t=30 mph\n8. Since she walks at the same rate for both (beach and sidewalk) then let's assume t is equal to time taken by her in order to complete the entire walk.\n   Then we have:\n   2*(speed of beach)*60/0.25=s *t or s/t=30 mph\n9. The total distance covered on the sidewalk will be: (speed*t)=(15/s) *s \n    We know that she walks at a rate for both places, then let's assume t is equal to time taken by her in order to complete the entire walk.\n   Then we have:\n  Total Distance = Speed*Time\n                 For beach=0.25/60*30 and for sidewalk (2*(speed of beach)*t)/1=(15/s) *s \n10. Let's calculate total distance covered on both places: \n\n    For Beach=total_distance_covered_beach=(Speed of beach)*(time)\n              =(0.5 mph)(30 minutes)= 3/4 mile\n    and for Sidewalk = Total Distance Covered (on the sidewalk)=(speed * time) \n                    =(2*(0.25/60)*t)/1=(15/s) *s or total_distance_covered_sidewalk= s*t where t equals to distance covered on the beach divided by speed of it plus 30 minutes\n11. We can then get: Total Distance = (Speed*Time)\n                        For Beach + Sidewalk \n                        3/4+total_distance_covered_sidewalk=15 miles or total_distance_covered sidewalk in mile equals  to ((s*t)-0.25/60)*t which is equal to (speed of beach)t+(2*(speed of beach))30 where s=t and t = distance covered on the beach divided by speed\n                        so this gives us: \n                        Total Distance Covered Sidewalk = total_distance_covered_sidewalk=15-3/4 or 11.75 miles in sidewalk which is equal to (0.25 mph)*t +2*(speed of beach)*(30 minutes)\n22. We can then get:\n    t= ((total distance covered on the sidewalk)/s) \n    where total_distance_covered_sidewalk =15-3/4 or 11.75 miles and s=(distance on beach)/(time taken)= (0.25 mph)*t\n23. Let's assume x to be a variable that represents time taken by Zahra in minutes, then: t=x= ((total distance covered on the sidewalk)/s) \n    where total_distance_covered_sidewalk =15-3/4 or 11.75 miles and s=(distance on beach)/(time taken)= (0.25 mph)*x\n24. So we have:\n   x=((Total Distance Covered Sidewalk)/speed of Zahra)\n   t=x= ((total distance covered sidewalk)/s)=(30 minutes) \n    where Total Distance Coverd Sidwalk = 11.75 miles and speed is equal to s=(0.25 mph)*t.\nAnswer: The final answer is 60",

    "logic_problem": {
      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \n1. First, let's find the time it takes for Beatriz to walk on the beach and on the sidewalk separately.\n   - Since 54 minutes of her total walking time is spent on the beach, we can represent this as (beach_time / beach_total_time) = (18 miles / 28 miles), where beach_total_time represents the fraction of the total distance that Beatriz walks on the beach. We need to use these two ratios in order to calculate both times.\n   - We know she spends x minutes walking on the sidewalk, so her time for walking on the beach is 54 minutes and her speed on the beach (b) * this time equals the miles walked on it which would be equal to 18 miles. \n   \n2. Now let's represent her speeds in terms of one variable.\n   - Let 's denote Beatriz' s speed as b for walking on the beach, then she walks at a rate of 2b when walking on the sidewalk.\n\n3. The time it takes for her to walk each segment is equal to distance/speed (time = d/v) and since we are working with variables here we'll say that t_b represents 'her time spent' in minutes while walking on the beach, therefore b*t_b = 18 miles.\n   - We can use this same formula for the sidewalk part of her walk: s is denoted as speed (2b), then x/t_s equals 10 where t_s is the total amount of time Beatriz walks at that particular speed.\n\n4. Now let's solve these equations to determine how long each segment takes.\n   - b*t_b =18\n   - We already know this one since we've been given it (54 minutes).\n   \n5. For sidewalk, 2b * x/60=10 which is solved for variable t_s or time on the walkway \n6. Solving these two equations results in the following:\nt_b=54 min and then finding an equivalent expression of this equation by substitution to find that\n    - t_s = (100) / b   minutes spent walking at sidewalk speed 2b\n\n7. Then, since it was given she walks 18 miles on beach while her time is 54 which is equal to the distance divided by rate therefore,\n     a= 18/b \n    - Substituting for 'a', we have t_s = (100) / b * (18/28)/(b)\n8. This can be simplified as follows:\n   - The expression simplifies to:  \nt_b + t_s\n(54)+(3000/(2*72))   \n9. Simplify the fraction and add it up.\n \nAnswer: 78",

First, let's determine the time it takes for Kayla to walk 19 kilometers on the beach and 12 kilometers on the sidewalk in terms of speed.\n\nLet x be her walking speed on the beach (in km/h).\nThen, her walking speed on the sidewalk is 2x (since she walks at two times the rate).\n\nSince distance = speed * time,\ntime taken to walk 19km on the beach is 19 / x hours\nand \ntime taken for 12 kilometers of sidewalk is 12 / (2x) hours.\n\nHowever, we are given that 57 minutes were spent walking on the beach. \n\nWe first need to convert this into hours: 57/60 = 0.95.\nThis means it took Kayla approximately .95 hours or about \n(19/x)*((1 hour)/(1 hour)) * (x/(3600 minutes))(180) minute  \n=   33 / x.\n\n3. Since time taken for beach + sidewalk is equal to total walktime, then let's determine the value of 'x'.\nWe already know that it took .95 hours = (19/x), which means \n(19/x)*((1 hour)/(1 hour)) * (x/(3600 minutes))(180) minute  \n= 33 / x.\nLet's use this equation to find out how long she takes for the sidewalk walk. \n\nTime spent on beach + time spent on the sidewalk = total time\nSo, we know that \n(19/x)*((1 hour)/(1 hour)) * (x/(3600 minutes))(180) minute  \n= 33 / x and ((12/2x)((1 hour)/ (1 hour))(x /(3600 min )))(60)min is the sidewalk portion of time. \n\nWe can then find out how long she takes for her walk by simply adding up this equation: \n(19/x)*((1 hour)/(1 hour)) * (x/(3600 minutes))(180 minute)\n+ ((12/2x)((1 hour)/ (1 hour))(x /(3600 min )))(60)min\n\nwhich is\n33 / x + 36o /x = total walk time.\n\nSince we know she walks at two times the rate of speed on sidewalk than beach, her walking speed for sidewalk portion will be twice as fast and that means it takes half as long.  \nIf (57 minutes)/((19 km)/(1km)) is approximately equal to \n33/x,\nand 12/2x is about half that time, then we can say\nthat the total walktime = (.95 + .58)*60 min which comes out to be 62.8.\nBut since you are given a problem in minutes and have not defined x yet (but it has been defined as walking speed on beach) I am going to try another method.\n\n4. Since we know that \n57 minute walk is approximately equal to about (.95 hours)*(3600 min)/(1 hour), then\nwe can also say the time for 12 km of sidewalk will be about ((36/2x)*((60)/ (1hour)))( x / (1 hr) )*(1hr/(180 minutes)). \nWe are now going to find out how long this is in terms of speed.\n\nLet's call her walking speed 's'.  \nThen, we know that\ndistance = rate * time.\nThis means 12 km equals the sidewalk distance can be expressed as follows:\n(2*s)*((60/1 hr)) *(x/(3600 min ))* (180 minutes)\nNow let us go back to step three and see how much of a difference it makes if we use this method.\n\n3.

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n1. Let's denote the speed at which Xena walks on the beach as 'b' miles per minute and her speed walking on the sidewalk as 5b, since she is five times faster.\n2. Since distance equals rate multiplied by time (d = rt), we can calculate the time spent on both parts of the trail:\n   a) Time spent walking on the beach: d1 / r1 = 11 miles / b\n   b) Time spent walking on the sidewalk: d2 / r2 = 10 miles / 5b \n3. The total walk is divided into these two times, so we can create an equation that represents Xena's entire trip:\n   Total time of the trip in minutes equals (time spent on beach + time spent on sidewalk) or (11/b) + (10/5b).\n4. We are told 66 minutes out of her total walk is spent walking on the beach, so we can write an equation that represents this information: \n    1 / b * 11 = 66.\n   This will be used to find 'b', Xena's speed in miles per minute when she walks on the beach. \n5. Now let us solve for b:\n   First multiply both sides of our equation by b (to eliminate division):\n      11 = 66b\n    Then divide each side of this new equation by 66, to isolate 'b':\n       b = 11 / 66.\n6. Having the speed at which Xena walks on her beach ('b' or approximately .16666667), we can use it in our prior formula (Total time of the trip) that is: \n   Total walk duration equals ((time spent walking on the beach + time spent walking on sidewalk)):\n    11 / b * (1/60 minutes per minute) + (10/(5*b)) * (1/minute).\n7. This will be used to find total duration in minutes of Xena's entire trip:\n   Total walk duration = ((66*60)/11) + (12/((5*(11/66)))) \n8. Since we have all the necessary information, let us plug them into our equation.\n9. Evaluate this expression using order operations and convert 66/(1/minute) to minutes by multiplying it with the rate in which Xena walks on the beach: \n   First calculate (12 / ((5 * b))) = (12 /((5*(11/66)))) then multiply both sides of our equation for time spent walking on sidewalk, or (time walked on sidewalk), 10 miles times the speed she is going when she walks on that part by one minute per mile and add this to it:\n     Total walk duration equals ((60*66)/11) + (12 /((5*(11/66)))) * (1/(minute)).\n\nLet us evaluate this expression, step-by-step:\n\nFirst let's compute the fraction 10 miles divided by speed of sidewalk in miles/min \n   since b = 11/66 and we can plug it into our equation to get a number for Xena's rate at which she walks on her favorite beach:\n    (12 / ((5*(11/66)))) * (1/(minute)) is equivalent to:  \n     (60*66) / (11 + (((10)/(11/66))*((1/min)))) \n    = 3600 - (660*6)/77\n   Next, let's calculate this number:\n      Total walk duration equals ((60*66)/11) + (12 /((5*(11/66)))) * (1/(minute))\n        ≈ 3600-48.\n10.

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \n1. First, let's calculate Kimia's speed on the beach and the sidewalk in miles per minute.\n   - Since 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach (15 miles), we can find her rate as follows:\n     Rate = Distance / Time\n     Beach Speed = 15 miles / 60 min = 0.25 mph\n\n2. Now, let's calculate Kimia's speed on the sidewalk.\n   - We know that she walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach: Sidewalk Speed = 2 * (Beach Speed) \n     Sidewalk Speed = 2 * 0.25 mph = 0.5 mph\n\n3. Now we will find how much time it takes her to walk 19 miles at a sidewalk rate and also calculate total minutes spent on both beach and sidewalk\n   - Time taken for walking 15 miles on the beach is already known (60 min)\n   - Sidewalk Speed = 0.5 mph, Distance covered on Sidewalk = 19 miles \n     So time required to walk at this speed on sidewalk will be:\n      Time = Distance / Rate  \n       Sidewalk Time = 19 miles / 0.5 mph\n                     =38 minutes\n\n4. Since the problem asks for how long it takes Kimia to complete her entire 34-mile walk, we just need to add up all of these times.\n   Total time spent on walking is (60 + 38) min \n   \nAnswer: The final answer is $\\boxed{98}$.",

    "logic_problem": {
      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\nLet's denote Kimia's speed on the beach as 'x'. Since she walks at two times this rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x.\n\nWe know that distance = speed × time. So we can write equations for both parts of her walk:\n- Time spent walking on the beach: 11 miles / x\n- Time spent walking on the sidewalk: 18 miles / (2x)\n\nGiven that she spends a total of 44 minutes on the beach, this is equal to 11/x hours. We need to convert these two time expressions into just 'hours' so they can be added together:\n(11 miles)/( x mile/hour) = 11/x hour\n\nAlso given: (18 miles)/((2x )mile/ hour)=9/(x )hour \nSo the total walk time is equal to:\nTotal Time spent on Beach + Total time Spent on Sidewalk\n=   (11 / x) hours+     ((18)/(2x))hours  \nUsing a common denominator of 2 we get: \n=(22 / (2 * x))+    ((9 )/ ( x))\nCombine these into one fraction:\n(31/x)\n\nWe are given that this is equal to the time in minutes, which needs to be converted from hours. Since there's 60 minutes per hour, multiply both sides by 60:\n\n=60*(11 /x) \nMultiply numerator and denominator of each term\n=(660)/(2*x)\nAdd these fractions together with a common denominator:\n(31/x)=(330 +9 )/( x)\n\nNow that we have this equation: (330+9)/ x =   660/ ( 2 * x), multiply both sides by 'x' to get rid of the fraction in the left side.\n\nMultiplying numerator and Denominator of each term\n    ((330+x) /x)= 330/x \nAnd multiplying the right-hand side gives:\n(330 +9)/x =   (660/ ( 2 * x))\nNow multiply both sides by '2*x' to get rid of this denominator on the RHS. Multiplying numerator and Denominator of each term\n    ((330+x) /x)*((2* x))=(330/x)*(2* x)\nCancel out common factors \n(330 +9)= 660 \n\nSubtracting 330 from both sides gives:\n   (330+ 9 -330)/1 = (660-330 )/ 1\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:  \n     0=330\nNow divide by 'x':\n    2 * x =660 \nDividing numerator and denominator of each term on RHS gives us an answer for x:\n   ( 660 /2)= x \n\nWe now have a value for speed in miles/hour. The question asked how long the entire walk took, so let's go back to our time expression from earlier: Total Time spent on Beach + Total time Spent on Sidewalk\n=Total Walk time \nNow convert this into minutes by multiplying it with 60:\n(31/x) * (660/2)\nFirst multiply numerator and Denominator of each term together, then cancel out common factors\n=( (11*330)+(9*(165)))/ x  \nThen the equation becomes: \n=((3630 +1485 ) /x )\nMultiplying numerator and denominator together to combine terms:\n(5115/x) hours * 60 minutes/hour = ((3.1 ×10^4)/(2×10))minutes\nMultiply both sides by ' (2*10)' for x, multiply the left-hand side's fraction: \n((6.22 × 10 ^3)/x)=   ( 0 )\nNow divide numerator and denominator of each term together:\n(5115 /1 )/ ((660/ 2)*60) = (51150)/(39600)\nDividing both sides by ' x' to find the total time in minutes: \n((6.22 ×10^3)/x)=   0 \n\nMultiplying numerator and Denominator of each term together, then divide by common factors:\n= 1\nTo calculate this expression we need an answer for (51150 /39600). Dividing both sides gives us the final time in minutes: \n(6.22 ×10^3) hours *60/((660/2 )hours)*60 = ((5.125×10 ^4)/ ((33*10)))\nNow divide numerator and denominator of each term together:\n=  (1.5499 /0.99)\nMultiply both sides by 'x' to find the value for x \n(51150/39600) *((2*x )minutes)=(660/60)*   ((6.22 ×10^3)/x )\nWe know that this expression is equal to our equation  (1.5499 /0.99)=5.\nTo get rid of 'x' on the left-hand side, divide by",

Since she walks at two times this rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.\n3. The distance covered while walking on the beach can be calculated using the formula Distance = Speed × Time. We know that Mei spends 60 minutes on the beach and covers a certain distance (15 miles). So we have: \n   15 = x * 60\n4. Solving for x, we get:\n   x = 15 / 60\n5. Now let's find her speed on the sidewalk using the value of x from step 4.\n6. Speed on the beach is already calculated as (x) which equals to 0.25 miles/minute and since she walks at two times this rate on the sidewalk, we have:\n   Speed = 2 * x\n        = 2 * (15 / 60)\n7. The time it takes for Mei to cover 28 miles can be calculated by adding up the individual walking distances of beach and sidewalk.\n8. First calculate how much time she spends on each segment:\n- Time spent on the beach: \n   Beach_time = Distance_on_beach / Speed_on_beach\n             = (15) / (0.25)\n9.

Since she walks at three times this rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 3B kilometers per hour.\n3. The time it takes for her to walk a certain distance can be calculated using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed\n4. We are given that Rania spends 48 minutes walking on the beach (12 km), so we need to convert this into hours first, since speed is usually measured in kilometers per hour.\n   - To do this conversion, let's use a common unit of time such as seconds or simply calculate it by dividing by 60. \n5. First convert 48 minutes to hours: 48 / 60 = 0.8\n6. Now we know that the distance (12 km) on the beach divided by her speed B and this is equal to the converted value of time which is 0.8.\n   - So, Time = Distance / Speed => 0.8 = 12/B \n7. To solve for B in this equation multiply both sides by B:\n    0.8 * B = 12\n   - Then divide each side of the equation by 0.8 to get your answer:  \n      B = 15 km/hour.\n8. Now, let's calculate her time on the sidewalk (18 kilometers) using this speed and then add them together with a total walking distance for an overall solution:\n    Time taken in beach is already known which equals 48 minutes\n   - We need to find out how long it will take Rania to walk at a rate of B =15 km/hour on the sidewalk (18 kilometers).\n9. Now we know that time taken can be calculated by dividing speed and distance: \n    Time for Sidewalk is 18/15 hours which equals approximately equal to an hour.\n10. But remember this value also needs conversion because it was asked in minutes:\n   - So multiply the value of 1 hour into total number of minutes, i.e., (60 * 1) = 60 \n11. Now we have our time taken for walking on the beach and sidewalk: \n    Time taken by Rania to walk at speed B is approximately equal to 48 + 60 which equals a final answer:\n   - Total time in this case would be 108 minutes",

      "answer": 1.0
    },
    "logic_problem": {
      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. On Sunday and Monday, Luca watched 2 episodes of a 4-hour show each night for two nights.\n   Total time spent watching this episode = (2 * number_of_episodes) + (number_of_nights - 1)\n   Since the length is per night, we need to subtract one day because it starts counting from zero. \n   Therefore total hours watched on Sunday and Monday are:  \n   (2*4)+((2-1))=8+1\n   Total time spent watching this episode = 9\n\n2. On Tuesday Luca watched some episodes of a show with length in minutes that we don't know yet but let's call it \"x\" hours for now.\n3. We will need to convert the number of x from hour form into minutes as well, because then when you multiply both sides by total amount of time and divide all terms containing an unknown variable (which is what Luca watched) on one side we can get rid of those numbers that were multiplied together during multiplication.\n\n4. The length in hours for this episode was given to us as x.\n   Therefore the number of minutes it lasted would be: 60x\n\n5. Since there are a certain amount of episodes (let's call them \"y\"), then total time spent watching these is y * (minutes per show).\n\n6. On Wednesday Luca watched one more long program that was four hours and forty-five minutes, let’s convert the number to just hour form: \n   45 min /60 =0.75\n    The length in hours of this episode would be 4+0.75=4.75.\n\n7. Finally on Thursday he got up late for two episodes lasting three hours each.\n   Therefore total time spent watching these is (2*3)=6\n\n8. If Luca watched a certain number, let's call it \"a\", then the equation can look like this: \n9. 19=(x*y)*60+4.75+(y*a)+9 \n\n10. This one doesn't seem easy to solve so we need some additional information that is missing from our previous steps - the amount of episodes on Wednesday (which was two) and Thursday which was four but also Luca watched a few episodes of another show with unknown length in minutes.\n    The number of these shows he could watch on Tuesday would be \"y\" (from step 5). \n\n11. We need to separate out x from other variables - this will require knowing how many hours it took watching those short programs or long ones, therefore we'll have to do some calculations.\n\n12. Luca watched two episodes in total of the first show he was talking about on Sunday and Monday.\n   So (2*4)+((2-1)) = 9 \n\n13. This means that his homework finished at least nine hours before watching TV which is a pretty short time but who knows? Maybe this kid has lots to do.\n\n14. On Wednesday Luca watched an extra episode of the long show we discussed earlier in step 6.\n   The number was (4+0.75)=4.75\n\n15. He also had some free time that lasted for one and a half hours because he got up late on Thursday but not so much to watch two episodes of this longer program which were each three hours long.\n\n16. Therefore total time spent watching these is 6 \n\n17. Now we know the amount of programs watched - it was four, let's separate out unknown variables from our initial equation with the help of known numbers in step 9.\n   \n   The correct version should be:\n   (15*x*y) +4.75+19=6*(2*3)+((y*a)*60)\n18. In order to find y we can start by dividing both sides on \"a\". \n   It will look like this: \n    ((15xy)/a)+(4.75/a)= 36+(1200*y)/(a*60) \n\n19. Since the length in hours for each of these episodes was given as x, then when you multiply both sides by total amount of time and divide all terms containing an unknown variable on one side we can get rid of those numbers that were multiplied together during multiplication.\n\n20. However, to do this step correctly first let's rewrite our equation from the previous steps (step 9) with variables separated:\n   We'll separate out x as well.\n21. The correct version should be: \n    ((15xy)/a)*60 +4.75+((y*a)*x*60)=6*(2*3)\n22. If Luca watched a certain number of episodes, let's call it \"b\", then the equation can look like this:\n23. 19=((15*x*y)+9+(45/60)+(y*b)*(1))*60 \n24. From our previous steps we already have two values - for Wednesday and Thursday: \n    (4+0.75) +6 =10.75\n25. Therefore total time spent watching",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \n1. Calculate the total hours of TV Sanjay watched on Tuesday and Wednesday:\n   - 6-hour episode * 2 nights = 12 hours\n2. Since we don't know how many episodes he watched, let's represent the number of episodes as 'x' for Thursday.\n3. The length of each show is 15 minutes or 0.25 hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). \n4. On Friday:\n   - He watched a single 2-hour episode and one 15-minute show, which can be represented by the equation: 1*2 + x*(0.25) = total TV time for that night.\n5. However we don't know how many episodes he had on Thursday so let's represent it as 'x'. Then calculate his Friday viewing in terms of hours:\n   - He watched one episode at two hour long and another short 15 minute show, which is equal to (1 *2) + x*0.25 = total TV time for that night.\n6. On Saturday he watched three episodes each lasting four hours, so the equation would be: \n   - 3*(4) = Total viewing on saturday\n7. Now we have a set of equations:\n    - The amount Sanjay watched in two nights (Tuesday and Wednesday): total time = 12.\n    - Then there is Friday night's watching which equals to ((2+x*0,25)\n    - There was an additional day where the TV that he had viewed for equalled (3 *4).\n8. Finally we know how many hours of viewing Sanjay did in all: 27\n9. So let's plug these values into a single equation:\n   total time = Tuesday + Wednesday + Thursday+ Friday+ Saturday \n10 Now this gives us the following equation that can be solved for x.\n11 - (12) + ((2)+(x*0,25))+(3 *4)= 27\n\nSimplifying it further to isolate 'x'.\n(14+x*0.25)=27-24\n14 + .25*x = 3 \n\nStep by step solving the equation:\nSubtracting both sides of this equation by fourteen: \n    x*.25= -11.\nDividing each side of this equation with *0,25 in order to solve for 'x':\n   x=-44",

The total time spent watching the 15-minute show on Thursday is unknown, but we know that's all he did on Thursday (no other shows).\n3. On Friday, Ravi watched a 2-hour episode and a 45-minute show. We can convert this to just minutes: \n   - A 2 hour long TV show would be equivalent to 120 minutes\n   - So the total time spent watching TV on Friday is 120 + 45 = 165 minutes.\n4. On Saturday, Ravi watched two episodes of his favorite show which each lasted for 240 (or) 4 hours in a day so he watched 2 * 8 = 16 hours of television\n5. Adding up the time spent watching TV on Tuesday and Wednesday: \n   - Time Spent on Tuesday & Wednesdays is 8 hours or equivalent to 480 minutes.\n6. Total amount of TV Ravi Watched in all, including Thursday is given as 20 hours which can be converted into min = (60*20)minutes =1200\n7. From the previous steps we know that he watched a total time equaling 480 +165+240=885 mins on Tuesday & Wednesday and Friday.\n8. Therefore Ravi must have spent his remaining TV watching minutes for Thursday, which can be calculated as \n   - Total min of all days =1200\n    Min Spent Watching Other Days = 885  \n9.

On Wednesday, we are asked to find how many episodes of a 15-minute show Bodhi watched. Since there's no information about other shows or their durations for this day only, it will be considered separately later on in the solution process.\n\n3. Thursday saw two different TV programs: one that is 5 hours long and another which was 30 minutes (or .50) hours. To make them comparable we need to add both of these together so they equal a whole number of hours as follows:\n\n   Total time for Thursday = 5 + .50\nTotal time in hours on Thursday = 5.50\n\n4. Friday Bodhi watched three episodes each being an hour and thirty minutes long, or (3 * 1.5) = 4.5 total TV hours.\n\n5. To determine the number of Wednesdays' show's episode we should add up all other days: \n   Total time for Monday + Tuesday = 6\nTotal time on Thursday = 5.50\nWednesday is unknown at this point so just represented by its variable x (in minutes), and since Bodhi watched a total of 21 hours, the sum from Wednesday will be in minutes as well.\n   Friday's shows last =4.5 \nThe equation would now look like: \n\n6 + .50 + x + 1.5 * 3 = Total TV Time\nx is Wednesdays' unknown time in minuts, this needs to equal total of all the other days shown above with an additional conversion (from hours) for that variable as follows:\n   Wednesday's show was only a fifteen-minute episode so it will be x*15 minutes. Now we can write our complete equation using 21 total TV hours *60min/hr = 1260 min \n\nThe full and final math problem should look like this: \n6 + .50 + (x) +4.5 = 1260\n\nCombine the first two constants into a single number:\n   The new constant is (7)\nNow add in other known numbers to the equation\n   This leaves us with x being only unknown, so that's what we will solve for now: \n   New Equation looks like this:\nx +4.5+ 6 + .50 =1260\n\nCombine all of our constants together into a single constant.\nThe new and complete set is (7+.50) or simply 7.50\nNow add the other numbers to that so we have just x left in variable form: \n   The result will be:\nx +11 = 1260 \n\nSolving for X, which represents Wednesdays' TV time, subtract both sides by eleven.\n   Subtracting eleven from each side of our equation now looks like this\n    New and final answer is below:\n\nStep x+11=1260 \nSubtract the left number on the right hand (side) to find value of  x.

On Saturday, James watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show.\n3. Let's represent the number of episodes as 'x'. Since each episode is 15 minutes long (or 0.25 hours), we can calculate total time spent watching this show:\n   Total time on Saturday = x * 0.25\n4. On Sunday, James watched a 4-hour episode and a 45-minute show.\n5. Convert the 45-minute show to hours: \n   45 minutes / 60 = 0.75 hour\n6. Calculate total hours spent watching TV on Sunday:\n   Total time on Sunday = (1 * 4) + (1 * 0.75) = 4.75 hours\n7. On Monday, James watched three 3-hour episodes.\n8. Calculate the total number of hours he watched these episodes: \n   Total time on Monday = 3 * 3 = 9 hours\n9. We know that in all, James watched 23 hours of TV. So we can write an equation:\n   The sum of total hours for each day equals to his total watching time.\n10. Now let's plug the values into this equation: \n    Total hours on Thursday and Friday + x * 0.25 (on Saturday) + 4.75 (Sunday) + 9 = 23\n11. We can now solve for 'x': \n   The sum of total hours for other days equals to his watching time minus the value of TV watched on Saturday.\n    Sum of hours on Thursday, Friday and Sunday plus Monday's episodes = 23 - x * 0.25\n12. Plug in known values:\n    Total hours (excluding Saturday) + x * 0.25 = 23\n\nNow let's simplify this equation by plugging the calculated value for total hours excluding TV watched on Saturday into it.\n   The sum of Thursday, Friday and Sunday plus Monday minus all that time is equal to his watching time - time spent in episodes at hand:\n    (8 + 4.75) + 9 = 23 - x * 0.25\n13. Calculate the total hours he watched on other days: \n   Total hours excluding Saturday's episode of short show.\n14. Simplify this equation and solve for 'x': \n   The sum equals to his watching time minus what was spent viewing episodes in question:\n    21.75 = 23 - x * 0.25\n15. Solve the above linear algebraic equation:  \n16. Subtract both sides by 23 (his total hours):\n17. Move all variable values on one side of the line and constant terms to another.\n   The new right-hand value equals minus the left-hand value, so we'll multiply with -1:\n    x *0.25 = 23-21.75\n18. Solve for 'x': \n    (23 - 21.75) / 0.25\n\nStep by step calculation: \n\n19. Calculate numerator first:\n   Subtracting the numbers in it.\n20. Result of subtraction is then divided into a divisor that contains decimal value.\n\nNow, let's perform these arithmetic operations to determine 'x' which represents number of episodes watched on Saturday:\n\n21. 23 - 21.75 = \n22. This equals: (1 * 10) + (-7/4)\n   Or:\n    1*4+(-2)+(-5)/4\n\n23. Calculate the above values.\n24. Multiply and add them together to get a result which is then divided by divisor with decimal value.\n\nNow, let's perform these arithmetic operations:\n\n25. (10-0) + (-7/4)\n   Or:\n    1*4+(-2)+(-5)/4\n\n26. Perform the addition of whole numbers in it.\n27. Now, we have: \n    -2+(−5/4)\n\n28.

      "question": "Oscar watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Saturday and Sunday, he watched a 3-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Monday, he watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show. On Tuesday, he finished homework early and watched a 6-hour episode and a 45-minute show.

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. Calculate the total hours of TV watched on Saturday and Sunday: \n   2 nights * 3-hour episode per night = 6 hours.\n\n2. Convert all time to minutes for easier calculation:\n   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.\n   - Monday's unknown number of episodes (in minutes) + Tuesday's 45-minute show + Wednesday's total episodes duration is calculated below.\n\n3. Calculate the total TV watched on each day after converting hours to minutes: \n   - Saturday and Sunday = 6 * 60 = 360 minutes\n   - On Monday, he watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show.\n     Let x be number of episodes (in whole numbers) Oscar watched:\n     Total time in minutes for the unknown episode is therefore 15x.\n\n4. Calculate Tuesday's total TV hours and convert it to minutes: \n   He finished homework early so that night he had extra time, watching a 6-hour show plus another short one.\n    The first was converted as before (360 = 24 * 60).\n     For the second episode of only 45 minutes:\n      Total minutes is therefore 24*60 + 45.\n\n5. Calculate Wednesday's total hours and convert it to minutes: \n   He watched four episodes, each being a 4-hour show.\n    Four shows are converted into whole numbers as before (48 * 3600).\n     Therefore the minute duration for all of his 3 hour long TV in one episode is calculated by taking this number and dividing it out from total time.\n\n6. Set up an equation to represent Oscar's overall amount of minutes spent watching:\n   Let x be Monday episodes, y = Tuesday's second show.\n    The total watched would then equal: \n       - (360 * 2) + (15x)\n        + ((24*60)+45)\n        + (((4)*48*60))\n      We want to find the number of minutes he spent watching on Monday\n   - Therefore, our equation is:\n     Total = 720 + 15x + 1455 + 9216\n\n7. Calculate total time in terms of x: \n    Simplify this by adding all values together except for 'x':  \n       Total = (720+45)+1460+(48*360)\n   - Combine numbers into one value:\n     Now we have the equation: \n        Total minutes watched is 1455 + 15 * x.\n\n8. Set up and solve an equation to find Oscar's episodes from Monday, with his known amount of overall time he spent watching TV in all.\n    This can be represented as follows: \n      (1455+15x)=29*60\n   - Then subtract the constant value:\n     1455 + 900 = 2355 = 15 * x\n\n9. Divide both sides by '15':  \n      To isolate variable we get a number for our answer.\n    This can be done as follows: \n        (x) = (2355 / 15)\n\nStep by step reasoning completed.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is $\\boxed{157}$.",

Her husband bought a new package with 18 spoons, so before he gave them to Emma, she must have used some of her own spoons along with those given to her by her husband to reach a total of 30 spoons.\n3. Since we don't know how many spoons were in the initial pack that Emma bought, let's assume it was x.\n4. After using 10 spoons for sampling and adding the package from her husband (which had 18 new spoons), she ended up with a total of 30 spoons.\n5. So we can form an equation: \n   Initial number of spoons + Number of spoons given by the husband - Spoons used = Total spoons\n6. Substituting known values into this equation, it becomes:\n   x (Initial pack) + 18 (pack from her husband) – 10 (used for sampling) = 30\n\n7.

So 5 children means we need 5*17=85 more skeins for their hats.\n- Similarly, for vests it is 15 skeins per child and since there are five she will require 5 * 15 = 75 more skeins of wool needed for the vest.\n- For leg warmers, each pair requires 7 skeins. There's two pairs required per person so that means a total of (2*7) or 14 skeins per child and since we have five children she needs to buy 5 * 14 = 70 more skein of wool for the leg warmers.\n- Lastly, socks require four skeins each but there are two needed per foot. With two feet that means a total of (2*4) or eight skein required per child and since we have five children she will need to buy an additional 5 *8 =40 more skein for the sock.\n\nNow let's add all these together: \n- For shawls, it was 90.\n- For hats, that is 85\n- Vests needed 75\n- The leg warmers required 70\n- And socks need to buy another 40\n\nWhen you sum them up (90 +85+75+70+40), we get a total of: \n\nStep by step reasoning done.\n\nAnswer: \nThe final answer is 360.",

Since each serving of bread has 475 calories and there are a total of 5 servings in the bag,\nwe need to calculate how much is one serving out of the entire 275 ounces:\nTo find this, first we will divide all servings (total) by number of servings: \nTotal Servings = Total Calories / Calories per Serving\nBut since here its already known that there are five and total calories for each are given so it can be calculated in next step.\n\n3. Calculate how many ounces are in one serving:\nTo find this, first we will divide all ounces (total) by number of servings: \nTotal Servings = Total Ounces / Number Of Servings\nThen multiply the result with 5 to get total calories.\nBut since here its already known that there are five and total amount is given so it can be calculated in next step.\n\n4. Calculate how many ounces you should eat for your remaining calorie target:\nFirst, we will find out how much of bag has been eaten by dividing consumed calories from each serving \nConsume Calories per Serving = 1350 / Servings (5)\nThen divide this with total ounce to get the amount which is already used then subtract that and multiply it with the number of servings.\nThe result for remaining ounces can be calculated as follows:\nRemaining Ounces * Remaining Servings\n\nBut let's solve in easier steps by calculating first what 1 serving equals: \nTotal Calories / Number Of Servings = Calories per Serving\nFor our case its already given so lets use this to calculate amount of bread we need.\n\n5. Now, let's find out how many servings you can eat with the remaining calories:\nServings left for day = Remaining Calorie Target / Calories Per Serving.\nSince each serving is 475 and there are only 1045 calories left, \n Servings Left For Day= Total Consumable Calories/Calories per Serving\n   Since it's already given that total consumable is 1045 so lets divide by the known amount.\n\n6.

Divide the remaining calories by the number of calories consumed from one group of five breads:\n   Calories per serving * Number of servongs = Total Calories\n   First, find total calories available for eating in a single bag: \n   Total Servings * Calories Per Serving  = Calorie Content Of The Bag   \n   Since there are 5 servings and the calorie content is unknown but it must be divisible by five we know that:\n     375*1 + 375*2+ ... + 375*n (where n <=5) can't exceed 2400.\n   However, since the bag contains 100 ounces and this isn’t specified in the question as an option to calculate total calories from,\n    Total Calories From A Bag = Calorie Content Of The Bag\n    In order for that we should use given data about a number of servings (5) \n     because there is no other info: Total Servings * Calories Per Serving  = Total Calories \n   and since the bag has only five possible numbers to choose from as total calories:\n     -375*0=Total Calorie Content Of The Bag\n       Total Servings * Calories Per Serving  != Calorie content of a single serving (which is given in problem)\n      which means there are no valid solutions for n <=5 \n    but since it's not an option to calculate total calories from bag, we can assume that:\n   -375*1=Total calorie content of the first part\n     Total Servings * Calories Per Serving  != Calorie Content Of The Bag  \n   However this isn’t a correct way.

We are given a specific amount that has 5 servings.\n \nHowever we do know the size of each portion/serving which is not necessary here because our answer only needs total ounces from remaining portions and that will be calculated using these consumable whole serving(s).\n\nRemaining Ounces = Total Servings * Serving Size - Consumed Portion\n= (3)  Since this was already given then we can calculate the actual size of each portion in relation to a specific number.\n= \n\n275 calories/serving = X ounces, therefore:\nX is our variable that represents serving/portion sizes for ounce.",

Since we want to know how many hamburgers they eat in one month, and a month has approximately 30 days (ignoring leap years), multiply their daily consumption by the number of days:\n   Family's total monthly consumption = family's daily consumption * days in a month\n ≈ 17 * 30\n\nAnswer: The final answer is $boxed{510}$.",

Calculate new number of empty beds:\n   Total available - newly filled = \n   Because we must not exceed our total capacity we need to make sure that it does not go higher.\n   Thus: \n    1500 - (300 + 1155) is incorrect since you cannot fill more than the hospital has\n   Correct one would be : \n   Occupied after admissions < Total Capacity, otherwise subtract from max:\n   occupied = min(occupies after admissions ,total capacity)\n   thus we get to this calculation: total ward-occupied wards\n    1500 - (min of (300+1155), 1500)",

The facility has a capacity of 1500 beds and is currently occupied at a rate of 1/6, which can be calculated as: \n   Occupied Beds = (1/6) * Total Capacity\n                  = (1/6) * 1500\n                  = 250 beds\n\n2. To find the unoccupied beds initially:\n   Unoccupied Beds = Total Capacity - Occupied Beds\n                    = 1500 - 250\n                    = 1250 beds\n\n3. Since there are 40 patients admitted each day, and we want to know how many days have passed in a week (4 weeks):\n   Number of Days Passed = Weeks * Days per Week\n                         = 4 * 7\n                         = 28 days\n\n4. To find the total number of new admissions:\n   Total Admissions = Daily Admission Rate * Number of Days Passed\n                    = 40 patients/day * 28 days\n                    = 1120 beds (Note: Since they're admitted to an existing capacity, this doesn't necessarily mean every bed will be occupied)\n\n5. However we are trying to find the total unoccupied space after a certain amount of time and new admissions have filled up some spaces that were initially empty.\n   To do so correctly we need consider only if these newly added patients cause any change in what is considered 'un-occupiable'. \n   \n6. The correct method would be, first calculate how many beds are occupied by the new admissions (1120), then subtract this number from our initial unoccupied amount to find out remaining free spaces.\n   Occupied Beds by New Admissions = Total Admission * Days\n = 40 patients/day * 28 days \n = 1120\n\n7. To calculate total available beds after these additions:\n   Available Spaces = Unoccupied Initially - New Patients Occupying them\n                    = Initial Un-Occupation + Total Capacity (since no one has been removed and all added space is considered part of the facility)\n                     However, for this particular question that seems not to be what we need.\n                     We can get our answer by taking \n                      Available Spaces after 4 weeks = total initial spaces - occupied initially - beds taken up due to admissions\n                       Thus,\n   Total available Bedspaces After Admissions is equal to Initial Capacity (1500) – Occupied Space Initially(250)- The new space that the newly admitted people have filled. Since we need calculate this:\n    Available Bedspace in care = 1500-250 -1120 \n                                =38 \n\nAnswer: The final answer is 38",

Now, we need to calculate the total unoccupied bed capacity in the medical center.\n   We can subtract the occupied beds after admitting patients from the initial capacity of hospital.\n   \n   Total Unoccupied Beds After Admission = Initial Capacity - Occupied Beds After Admission\n = 1200 - 710\n = 490\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 490.",

The clinic has a capacity of 1500 rooms and is occupied at the rate of 3/4.\n   So, to find out how many rooms are currently occupied:\n   \n   Occupied rooms = (Capacity * Occupancy) / 100\n   \n   Given that occupancy level in percentage form for three fourths would be: \n   (75/100)*1500\n   Therefore,\n   \n   Occupied rooms = (75 * 15)/1\n   \n   Which simplifies to 1125\n\n2. Now, let's find out the number of unoccupied rooms:\n   \n   Unoccupied rooms = Total capacity - Occupied rooms\n   \n   We know that total capacity is 1500 and occupied room count is 1125.\n   \n   Therefore,\n   \n   Unoccupied rooms = (15 * 100) - 1125\n                     = 1500-1125 \n                      which simplifies to:  \n                    \n3. Since the natural disaster will cause patients admission for a period of two weeks, we should calculate how many more unoccupied room there are left in clinic after this duration.\n\n   As it is given that each day 25 new patients are admitted and total capacity was assumed constant from step1.\n   \n   For simplifying our calculation let's see the no. of days available for disaster response\n   \n   Disaster Response Duration = Total Number of Days * No. of weeks\n                               = (7*2)\n                               \n4. We can calculate number unoccupied room left after 14days by subtracting product of admitted patients and total duration from un-occupied rooms count we obtained in step3.\n   \n   Let's start this calculation now:\n   \n   Total Number of Patients Admitted During Two Weeks\n    = No. Of Patiants per day * Duration In days\n   \n   So,\n   \n   25*14\n   \n   Now, let us simplify it: \n   \n   Therefore,\n\nNow we will add the result in step2 with total no. of patients admitted and subtract to get final count:\n    \n   Unoccupied Rooms Count After Two weeks = (1500-1125) - (25 *14)\n\n which simplifies to 1375 -350\n   \n    Answer: \n    The final answer is $\\boxed{1025}$",

To find the total amount she'll pay for all the screws, we need to multiply this price by the number of screws (17).\n   Total cost = Number of screws * Cost per screw\n              = 17 * $0.37 \n3. Now let's calculate the product.\n4. Multiply 17 and 0.37: \n   17 × 10/30 = 170/30  \n5. Reduce this fraction to a decimal or simplify it further if necessary:\n6. Simplifying gives us approximately $5.67, which is also equivalent as 567 /100\n7. Since Olga has an initial amount of money ($81.29), we can now subtract the total cost she'll pay for the screws from her initial amount to find out how much she has left.\n   Money Left = Initial Amount - Total Cost\n\n8. We know that $5.67 is also equivalent as 567 /100 which makes it easier in calculations since \n    money left would be calculated using whole numbers and fractions by adding or subtracting these, the following steps can now use a simpler form of calculation.\n9. Now let's find out how much Olga has after buying the screws:\n   Money Left = Initial Amount - (567/100)\n              ≈ $81.29 - 0.0567 * 10^2 \n10. Convert this into an easier fraction format, which would be in decimal form to make it simpler\n11. The simplified calculation for money left is now as follows: \n   Money Left = Initial Amount – Total Cost \n                $81.29000000 – (5/100) + ((29)/100)\n12.

They want to reach a goal of 140 signatures in total, and they still have 4 more weeks left (since there are typically around 6-8 weeks per spring break).\n3. However, since the question only mentions \"every afternoon collecting\" for 7 weeks before comparing their autograph books, it is safe to assume that the remaining time will be used as well.\n   To calculate how many signatures they need in total: \n    Total desired - Current number of signatures = Signatures needed\n4. The current number of signatures (72) can only come from these 7 weeks, so we must find out what portion of spring break has passed and use this to figure the remaining time.\n   Let's assume an average duration for a school spring break is about eight weeks; \n    Since they have collected their books after 7 weeks then:\n       Time left / Total Spring Break = (4/8) *100\n5. If we multiply the total number of signatures in one week by this value, it will give us how many more signatures Quinn and Olga need to collect over these remaining four weeks.\n6. Then subtract that from our target of 140.\n\nStep-by-step calculation:\n- Total desired: 140 \n- Current signature count for both sisters :72\n- Signatures per day * (4/8) = Signatures needed in the next 28 days.\n   If we let 'x' be signatures collected each week, then x*(7+4)/2 would give total signatures that Quinn and Olga will have. Since they are aiming to reach a signature count of 140 by end of break,\n    We get: (x *11/2) = 140\n   - Solve for 'x' : Multiply both sides with 2, divide each side with 11 \n      x= 140*2 /11 \n     Then multiply this value to the number of days remaining in spring break.\n- Calculate how many signatures they need over these four weeks:\n    Total signature collected so far is: (15+57) =72\n   - Desired total : 140. Subtracting current total from desired gives Quinn and Olga's target for next month \n     Target for the sisters is to get their autograph books up to a combined value of 140 signatures by end break.\n- The number needed in these four weeks can be calculated as follows: (Target - Current signature count) = Signatures required over this time period\n    Required signature count = (140-72)\n   Now we know the sisters will need 68 more total autographs.",

Since they already collected some signatures in those two upcoming weeks (but not for the entire duration), we will consider only one week as additional time available before reaching their goal and calculate how many more signatures are needed from this point onwards to reach a total of 110.\n\nSince Yara has currently 34 signatures, she needs to collect x + y where 'x' is her signature collection per day for the first four weeks (we don't know it yet), \nand 'y' would be collected over two more weeks. We do not have any specific details about daily/weekly collections so we can only focus on Aisha's current weekly average to estimate their total capacity.\nAisha has 49 signatures and she needs a certain number of x + y (just like Yara), which is the collection in the first four weeks plus two additional ones. We know that they have already collected for one more week than needed from now until the end of summer break, so we need to focus on how many are left by focusing only on their current 2-week total.\nWe can get an estimate based on Yara's and Aisha's signatures after four weeks (83) + two additional ones. For this scenario: \n- Let 'w' denote weekly collection for each sister during those first six weeks, so that w is the number of collections collected by both sisters in a week.\n\nGiven 6 * w = current total (since they've spent one whole summer month), which means that\n4 * w + 2 * w equals to their actual numbers after four and two additional ones: \n(83) / (total weeks).\nTherefore, Aisha needs x + y more signatures. To figure out 'x' or the weekly average we can assume both of them will have same number for simplicity as they are doing this in collaboration.\nThe sisters need a total 110 - 83 = <<27=27>>27\nThey only had two weeks left which is 2 * w (not one) to get their goal. \n\nWe don't know 'w', but we can find it using the following formula: \n4*w + 2*W = 49+34\n\nCombine like terms:\n(6)* W=83\n\n\nNow, divide both sides by 6.\nSo now you have w= (83)/6\nTherefore,\nW ≈13.8 \n\nThe sisters need to collect a total of 27 signatures in the last two weeks where they each get approximately half for simplicity sake since we can't calculate this without knowing their distribution but assuming it is divided equally between them:\n(1/2) * w = (13.8)/2\nTherefore,\nw=6.9\n\nThe sisters need to collect a total of 27 signatures in the last two weeks where they each get approximately half for simplicity sake since we can't calculate this without knowing their distribution but assuming it is divided equally between them:\n(1/2) * w = (13.8)/2\nTherefore,\nw=6.9",

First, let's calculate the transfer fees that Mr. Brown paid.\n   Transfer fees = 1% of $480000\n                 = (1/100) * $480000\n                 = $4800\n\n2. Next, we'll calculate the brokerage fee that he paid.\n   Brokerage fee = 2% of $480000\n                  = (2/100) * $480000\n                  = $9600\n\n3. Now, let's find out how much Mr. Brown has after paying both fees and the remaining loan amount.\n   Remaining loan amount = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee - Loan paid for the remaining balance\n                          Since he already sold it we will use the price of selling to determine this equation: \n                         (480000 - 330000) is not needed here because that would be incorrect, what is left after paying both transfer and brokerage.\n   The correct way should look like this:\n   Remaining loan amount = Selling Price - Loan Paid for remaining balance\n                          = $480000 - $330000\n                          = $150000 \n\n4. However the equation in step 3 was a little confusing so we'll break it down into parts, Mr Brown has already paid all of his transfer and brokerage fees which were:\n   Transfer + Brokerage fee \n   = $4800 (1% of selling price) + $9600\n   = $14400\n\n5. Now subtract the total amount he's paid in transfer and brokerage from the Selling Price to find out how much money Mr Brown still owes on his loan.\n  Remaining balance after paying fees = Selling price - Transfer fee and Brokerage \n (since these two are already paid)\n = Total of what is left for him to pay off\n   = $480000 - $14400\n    =$465600\n\n6. Now we will find out Mr Brown's net proceeds from selling the villa by subtracting this amount that he still owes on his loan with remaining balance after paying all transfer and brokerage fees.\n  Net Proceeds from sale of Villa \n    (Which is what left for him to keep)\n   = Total remaining money minus Loan\n     =$465600 - $330000\n      =$135600 \n\nAnswer: The final answer is $135600.",

Next, we'll find out how much he paid for brokerage fees in relation to his villa's sale amount.\nBrokerage fee = 2% * $450000 \n= (0.02) * ($450000)\n= $9000 \n\n3. Now let's calculate the total expenses incurred by Mr. Brown on transfer and brokerage fees combined\nTotal expense = Transfer fee + Brokerage Fee \n                 = $18000 + $9000\n                  =$27000\n\n4. The remaining loan amount of his villa that he paid back is given as $120000.\n5. To determine Mr. Brown's net proceeds from selling the villa, we subtract both total expenses and the remaining loan amount from the sale price:\nNet Proceeds = Selling Price - Total Expense  - Remaining Loan Amount \n               =$450000 - $27000 - $120000\n                =$111000",

If the total cost is ¥740 and the youth club covers 1/10 of this, then they are covering ¥(1/10)*740 = ¥74\n\n3. This leaves Sanjay with having to pay for his portion as well since he has only ¥185: \n   Since we don't know how much money Sanjay needs in total yet but we do know that the youth club will be paying $74, then let's subtract 74 from 740 which is equal to:\n    ¥(740 - 74) = ¥666\n4.

The remaining cost that needs paying for, would be represented as: \n   ¥666\n\n5.

We know that Roya eats 4 pieces a day and Mei eats twice as much.\nSo, Mei's daily consumption = 2 * Roya's daily consumption\n= 2 * 4\n= 8\n\nNow we have the combined rate at which they are eating:\nCombined rate of eating pizza per day = Roya's rate + Mei's rate \n= 4 + 8 \n= 12 \n\nSince there are a total of 24 pieces and their combined daily consumption is 12, to find out how many days it will last we divide the total number by their combined daily rate.\nNumber of days pizza lasts = Total Pizza / Combined Rate\n= 24/12\nHowever since they both eat together every day. Then you have two options here:\nA) Divide 24 pieces into as equal parts that Roya and Mei can each consume per day individually, then divide the number found by 2 (if we consider them eating separately), or \nB) Simply keep dividing the total pizza in one go.\n\nIn this scenario since they are both consuming at a combined rate of 12 pieces. Then we simply take out their combined daily consumption.\nNow let's do that for you:\n24 divided into Roya and Mei's daily intake is actually done below (option B).\nHowever to follow your instruction on steps: \nSince the pizza will be consumed by them together in one go each time, it will last as many days as there are total pieces of pizza eaten per day. The question asked us how long their shared eating rate would take.\nTherefore we must divide 24 into what they both consume when eating at a combined daily consumption.\n\nThe number found out is equal to the two people's individual rates multiplied together divided by one which equals their joint eating frequency in terms of days.\nWhich, if you are following along with me mathematically. Looks like this:\n24/12\n= 2\n\nHowever I'll make sure that we understand it correctly now and also confirm whether or not our previous solution was correct.\n\nWhen there is only two people eating from the pizza together as one unit. The number of days a shared food item lasts when eaten by them, can be calculated in this way:\n24/12 \n= 2",

Since Carlos can eat 3 servings a day, then Nia can eat 8 * 3 = 24 servings a day.\n3. The total number of people eating the lasagna is two (Carlos and Nia), so we need to find out their combined daily consumption: 3 + 24 = 27\n4. Since they both eat an equal amount, then together Carlos & Nia consume as much as one person who eats 27 servings a day.\n5. Given that the lasagna has 27 servings and two people can each have three servings per day, we will divide total number of servings by combined daily consumption: \n   - Total number of servings = 27\n   - Combined daily consumption for Carlos & Nia is equivalent to one person eating 3 servings a day.\n6. To find out the days it takes both Carlos and Nia together to finish the lasagna, we will divide total servings (which equals their combined weekly intake) by daily amount: \n   - Total number of people = 2\n   - Each can eat three per day for that two person rate equaling a single persons eating habits.\n7.

Next, we need to calculate how many floors can be cleaned per hour and then multiply it with the working time (in hours). It takes them 15 minutes per floor so that's:\n   - Floors cleaned per minute : 1 / 15\n   - Floors cleaned per hour: (1/15) * 60 = 4 \n3. Since they clean for 10 hours a day, we multiply the floors cleaned in an hour with their working time to get total number of floors cleaned each day:\n   - Total floor cleaned/day : 4 * 10 = 40\n4. Now that we know how many floors are cleaned per day and what is required (80), let's find out if they can clean all the floors on schedule, in this case: \n    The cleaner will be able to complete cleaning of hospital in less than or equal to their given time frame.\n5. Next step would involve finding total number of minutes it takes them for entire job:\n   - Total floor : 80\n   - Floors cleaned per hour (as calculated above): 4\n   - Total hours required: 80 / 4 = 20\n6. Since the cleaner has to complete this in 5 days, we first find out total number of minutes they have for entire job:\n    We know that they clean floors at a rate of 40 per day (as calculated earlier) and there are only five working days.\n   - Total floor cleaned: 80\n   - Floors cleaned/day : 40 \n   - Number of working days required to finish the cleaning work: total_floor / floors_cleaned_per_day = 2. Since we need 5, let's proceed further:\n7. Let’s calculate how many minutes they spend on each day in average for this job (assuming no breaks):\n    We know that it takes them 600 minutes/day.\n8. Now to find percentage of their working hours spent cleaning floors per day: \n   - They work 10 hours a day and clean the entire hospital in 2 days, so let's calculate total number of floor cleaned by cleaner each hour:\n     - Total_hours_required : 20\n     - Hours_spent_per_day (in this case): since they have to finish it within five working days: \n       Given that we want percentage of time spent cleaning floors per day. We need hours/day, for two-day job and then calculate percentage.\n   Let's proceed with the same logic:\n    To find total minutes required to clean all hospital in 5 days, let’s first find out number of hour they spend on this entire task: \n     - Total_minutes_required = (15 * 80) / (60*24), which is approximately equal to 7.0833\n   But we know that cleaner works only for ten hours a day.\n9. Now since there are five working days, let’s find the total number of hour required:\n    We have: Total_minutes_required = 600 minutes/day * 5 days \n10 Finally, with this information, to get average time spent per floor cleaning on any given day in terms of percentage we need hours/day for a two-day job and then calculate percentage.\n     - They work for ten hours each day but since they finish their entire task within five working days:\n    So the total number of minute required is: \n   (5 * 600) / 2 = 1500 minutes\n11 Now to get average time spent cleaning per hour, let’s divide it with total number of floor cleaned in two-day job and multiply by 100.\n     - Total_hours_spent_per_day : since they finish the work within five days working for ten hours/day but take only 2 days: \n        It is equal to (10 *5) / 2 = 25\n12 Finally, let’s find average time spent cleaning floors in terms of percentage:\n    Average_time_percentage_cleaning_floors_per_day : ((15*80)/((600/100)*25)) \n\nAnswer: The final answer is $\\boxed{40}$",

The total number of floors is given as 90.\n3. Since it takes them 30 minutes per floor to clean and they work for a certain amount of time every day, we can find out how many floors they clean each day: \n   - First calculate the number of days needed if cleaned all hours: Total minutes / minutes spent on each floor = total_time_spent_on_floors\n    90 * 30 = 2700.\n   - The cleaner has a limited time to work in, so we need to find out how many floors they clean per day. To do that, let's divide the total working hours by their hourly rate of cleaning (which is not given directly):\n     Since there are 600 minutes worked each day and it takes them 30 min/floor, \n     number_of_floors_cleaned_per_day = Total_minutes / floor_time\n    - In order to find out what percentage they clean in a single working session we need the following:\n      (number of floors cleaned per day) / (total minutes worked each day)\n4. Calculate how many days it would take them if all their time was spent cleaning: \n   Since there are 600 * 30 = 18000 min, and since they work for a certain amount of this at any given point:\n    Total number of floors cleaned by the cleaner in total / The average minutes worked each day\n5. After knowing how many days it would take them if all their time was spent cleaning we can calculate what percent of that time is actually used to clean.\n\nAnswer: \n- (600/30) = 20, this tells us they have enough work for a whole month in just one hour.\n    - The percentage the cleaner uses out of each day on floor maintenance will then be:\n      floors cleaned per session / total minutes worked by person each day\n       So now we know how many sessions are completed over all days and what time is spent in any given cleaning period, \n     This number will turn into: ((number_of_floors_cleaned_per_day)/(Total_minutes_worked_per_day))*100.\n    - To find the percentage of their day that's used for maintenance, let us use this formula to get our result:\n      (20) / 600 *100 = 3.333... \nSo after all calculations we can safely assume they spend approximately\nThe final answer is: 3",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. Elena starts with ¥1400.\n2. To find the cost of cotton candy, first calculate the regular price for 23 kgs at ¥21 per kg: \n   - Regular price = Number of kilograms × Price per kilogram\n   - Regular price = 17 + (4 and 2/3) * total number of items in this fraction\n   Since there are 5 parts to a whole, the denominator needs to be multiplied by that part to get an integer for calculation.\n   First find how many integers is four and two thirds equaling. We can convert it into mixed numbers or decimal: \n   - The improper fraction 14/3 can also be expressed as 4 2/3 = 16 / 5\n   Now multiply by the total number of items (17+23=40) in this fraction.\n   - Regular price = (4 * 8 + 2*1 ) / 5 \n      which is equal to: ((32)+(2)/ 5)\n   And calculate that decimal for you:\n     Which can also be expressed as ((32/5)+0.4). This equals to an integer of 6 and a fraction of (2/5) * 8 = 1.6\n    - Regular price = 17 + 23*16 /40 \n   Next, multiply the number by regular decimal value for ease:\n     Now calculate: 17 + (0.55)*23 \n   Which is equal to:  \n        a regular price of 17+12.65=29.65\n3. Calculate discount on cotton candy.\n   Discount = ¥21 × Fraction to be discounted off * Number of items in this fraction / total number of items \n    Since there are five parts, multiply the denominator by that part for calculation:\n     - We will find out how many integers is four and two thirds equaling:  \n      As mentioned before (4 2/3 =16/5)\n   Now we can use decimal multiplication to make it simpler. \n     A regular price of ¥21 * discount fraction with an integer, which equals a total discount value of: 6 + 1.6\n    - Total discount value is equal to:\n      Which can also be expressed as ((32)+(2)/5) or (16/5)\n   Now multiply the number by regular decimal value for ease.\n     A regular price of ¥21 * discount fraction with an integer, which equals a total discount value of: 0.55*8 \n    - Total discount is equal to:\n      Which can also be expressed as ((32)+(2)/5) or (16/5)\n   Now multiply the number by regular decimal value for ease.\n     A regular price of ¥21 * discount fraction with an integer, which equals a total discount value of: 4.40\n4. Calculate final cost of cotton candy:\n   Final Cost = Regular Price - Discount \n    - Final cost is equal to (29 +12.65) - (4+1.6)\n5. Now we can calculate the regular price with an integer for calculation.\n     A regular price of ¥21 * discount fraction with an integer, which equals a total final cost: 17-0.55\n    - Total final cost is equal to:\n      Which can also be expressed as ((32)+(2)/5) or (16/5)\n   Now multiply the number by regular decimal value for ease.\n     A regular price of ¥21 * discount fraction with an integer, which equals a total final cost: 12.65-4\n    - Total final cost is equal to:\n      Which can also be expressed as ((32)+(2)/5) or (16/5)\n   Now multiply the number by regular decimal value for ease.\n     A regular price of ¥21 * discount fraction with an integer, which equals a total final cost: 8.65\n6. Calculate total cost for all items:\n    - Total Cost = Final Cotton Candy Cost + Coral Pieces Price + Pins Price \n7. Now calculate the number to be subtracted from Elena's original amount (¥1400) and find out how much money she has left.\n   Money Left = Original Amount - Total Cost\n8. Finally, we can now put all of this into a single equation.\n\nStep by step calculation: \n\n1st Step:\n17+23=40 \n- The improper fraction 14/3 is equal to the mixed number (4 and two thirds).\n2nd step:\n ((32)+(2)/5) =((16)+(2)*8 / 10 )\n   Which equals a total decimal of :6.4\n   We can also calculate that as follows: 0.55*23=12.65 \n3rd Step:\nA regular price is equal to (17 + (12/40)) * 21.\n- A discount fraction with an integer, which is equal to ((32)+(2)/5)\n4th",

First, we need to calculate the cost of 15 kilograms of cotton candy at ₺21 per kilogram: \n   Cost = (number of kilograms) * (price per kilogram)\n   Since Isabella bought a total of 22 kilograms and got some for free,\n   let's separate it into two parts:\n   Part one: The first part is the regular price, which is buying all the required quantity. This will be \n   cost1 = number_of_kilograms * (price_per_kilogram)  \n   Since we know she bought 15 kilograms at ₺21 per kilogram,\n   it becomes \n       cost1 = 15 kg * ₺21/kg\n   Now, calculate this value:\n   cost1 = 315\n\n2. Next is the second part of her purchase: buying some cotton candy for 2/3 off.\n    Since Isabella bought a total of 22 kilograms and got 5 free (which we will call \"free_kilograms\" in our calculation), \n       she must have spent money on (total quantity - free_kilograms) which equals\n   part_two = 15 + (the extra that wasn’t discounted)\n   In this case, the total number of kilograms bought is 22 and since there are '5' kilograms for \"2/3 off\", then \n       we need to find out how much she paid in addition to these five. Therefore,\n    free_kilograms = 5\n    extra_for_full_price = (part_two - free_kilograms)\n   Since Isabella bought a total of 22 kg, and the first part is buying all at ₺21 per kilogram,\n       then \n      extra_for_full_price = part_two - free kilograms\n     This becomes:\n        extra for full price = [15 + ((total_quantity) - (free_kilograms))] – [(5)]\n         extra for full price= 22-5, so it equals to:  \n         extra for full price =17 kg. Now let's calculate the cost of this part.\n    To find out how much money she paid in total on cotton candy,\n     we'll multiply by (the discount applied) \n      Let 'x' be the original discounted amount at 2/3 off, and since Isabella got a \"buy one get one free\" deal:\n        if x is full price for each kilogram of cotton candy that was bought at regular rate\n       then:  \n          The cost would have been (full_price_for_x * extra_kg) with the discount applied to it.\n         However, we already know she got '5 kg' discounted which means \n            2/3 is removed from a full price for each kilogram and so instead of getting:\n   x = ₺21 per kilo\n    She pays (1 - discount_percentage), or just: cost_per_kg * (1 – discount_percentage) with the total free kilograms already factored into our calculation.\n  In other words, to calculate 'cost_of_discounted_part', we get \n     This equals:\n      cost_per_kilo = ₺21 per kilogram\n    discount_percentage = 2/3 or just: .66666\n   Now let's proceed with the formula for calculating the total cost of the discounted part.\n         Let y be a full price at regular rate, then it becomes \n        cost_of_discounted_part= [y * (1 - (discount_percentage))] which is also equal to:\n        (cost_per_kilo) * 2/3\n       So in our case we have:  \n   cost_of_free = ₺21 per kilogram. Since there are five free kilograms, then \n   the amount paid for that discounted part will be: \n    y * ((1 - discount_percentage)) or simply [(full_price_per_kilo) – (discount_applied)] with '5' already subtracted from total number of kilograms.\n   Let's proceed by finding out how much she paid on those 17 additional kilograms after the \"2/3 off\" deal. Since there are five free, then \n    cost_of_discounted_part = ₺21 * ((1 - .66666)) with '5' already subtracted from total number of kilograms.\n   So it becomes\n      discounted_cost = (cost_per_kilo) – ((discount_percentage))\n     To get this we'll have to perform the following calculation: \n    cost_of_discounted_part= ₺21 * 0.33333  \n       Now, let's calculate the result:\n        This gives us a total of (7)\n   The final cost for those additional kilograms after applying \"2/3 off\" deal is: \n      discounted_cost = ₺7\n     And now we can proceed with calculating the full price by simply adding up these costs. So in our case, it becomes\n       first_part_cost + second_part_cost:\n    total_cotton_candy_price = (cost1",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \n1. Xena buys 15 kgs of saltwater taffy at ₺23 per kg, so the cost is 15 * ₺23 = ₺345.\n2. She also gets 4 kgs half off, which costs (₺23 / 2) * 4 = ₺46. The total savings from this promotion would be \n   ₺23 - ($23/2). Since it's a \"half-off\" sale the correct amount is:\n   $23 - ($23/2) is incorrect and should instead read: ($23-($23/2)).  \n   1st calculate the value of ($23/2): (₺23)/2 = ₺11.5\n   Then subtract that from the original price per kg to get your \"half-off\" cost:\n   $23 - $11.50 is equal to: \n    $23-$11.50=$11.50. Now we know how much she paid for 4 kgs of saltwater taffy after getting half off.\n3. The total savings from the promotion would be ₺23 - (₺23/2) = ₺0, however since it's a \"half-off\" sale that is incorrect and should read: ($23-$11.50). \n4. To get her total cost of saltwater taffy she needs to add these two values together.\n   First calculate the value of (15 * 23), which we already know from step one equals ₺345, then take  $23-($23/2) and multiply by four: ($11.50)*4 = $46\n5. Now that we have our total cost for saltwater taffy in dollars add those two numbers together to get the final value.\n   Add (15 * 23), which is ₺345, with the result of step 3 multiplied by four since it represents her savings: \n     ($11.50)*4=$46\n6. After adding these values we can calculate Xena's total cost for saltwater taffy:\n    $345 +$46= $391.\n7. The original price per starfish was not given in the problem, but she bought 1 bag of them at ₺11.5 and keychains were purchased at a rate that would be found using: \n   (14 * ₺21.25)\n8. Now calculate her total cost for saltwater taffy:\n    $391 +$11.50=$402.50\n9. Next, multiply the number of keychain's by their price to get Xena's final purchase amount.\n10 Multiply 14 and ₺21.25 together: \n   (14 * ₺21.25) = ₺297.\n11 Add this result with her total cost for saltwater taffy:\n    $402.50 +$297= $699.5\n12 After adding these values we can calculate Xena's final purchase amount in dollars and cents.\n13 Subtract the value of keychains from the original 1400 to determine how much money she has left: \n   ₺1400 - (₺302)\n14 The problem states that her parents gave her ₺1400 for vacation, so subtract this result with Xena's final purchase amount in dollars and cents:\n    $1400-$699.50= 700.5",

Since Kimia bought rock candy in excess of what was included with this deal, calculate how much she saved on the \"6 pounds 2/3 off\" part (which we can also write as 20 / 3 or approximately 6.6667) portion by first converting that to a decimal: \n   The fraction is equivalent to 6 + (2/3), so it's like having an extra .667 of rock candy included free.\n\n3. Convert this into the actual savings:\n    We know she got 'free' pounds, we just have to calculate how much those cost at regular price.\n     Price for that portion would be: (.6667) * 22 = $14.75 (approximately). \n\n4. Subtracting her \"discount\" from full price of a purchase gets you the savings:\n   So Kimia saved approximately $14.75.\n\n5. The total rock candy cost is therefore the original price, minus what she would've paid for it at regular price ($330 - 14.75 =) \n    Therefore: the final amount spent on the rock candy was about: (300), however we should use a precise calculation here to make sure accuracy.\n   $22 * 15 + (-$22/3)*6 = (330-(-110))=440 \n\n5. Calculate the cost of mixed bag of sea glass:\n    Cost is simply what Kimia paid, which was about: ($11.75).\n    \n6. Find out how much she spent on stickers by multiplying price per sticker with number purchased:\n   Number of Stickers bought were 17 * $21.25 = approximately.\n\n7. Finally we can calculate the total cost for all items to find the final amount left.\n    Total money Kimia paid is: ($440) + (11.75) + (366.25)\n   \n8. Subtract this from her original budget, and you get:\n   The remaining cash after shopping = $1300 - 818 \n\nAnswer: \nThe final answer is $482",

The cost of buying 15 kilograms at ₣23 per kilogram is calculated as follows:\n   Cost = Number of kilograms * Price per kilogram\n         = 15 kg * ₣23/kg\n         = ₣345\n\n2. Since Gabrielle also bought an extra 6 kilograms (21 - 15), we need to calculate the cost for these additional kilograms separately.\n   However, there's a sale: \"get 4 kilograms 1/4 off.\" \n   So first find out which of those four are part of this deal since she only got six. The price would be reduced by one fourth or (3/4) times ₣23 on the other two and normal for all others.\n   \n   - Cost for additional kilograms that were not discounted: 2 kg * ₣23/kg = ₣46\n   - Cost of 4 extra kilograms with discount: (1/4)*₣23 = ₣5.75, then subtract this amount from the original price and multiply by four to get the total cost of these items.\n     Total for discounted kilogram purchase would be: [(3/4) * ₣23] * 4 - [($5.75)] since we must also remove it as an item that is being removed \n   This can then simplified into (3 * ₣23)/₺1 - ₱5.75 = $[69-5.75]\n   \n     Since there are four of these, the cost for them all would be: 4 * [($23.25)]\n     \n     So total discounted kilogram purchase is:   $93\n\nNow we add this to our first price from before:\n ₣46 + ₺93 = ₤139 \n\n3.

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \n1. Calculate the cost of 16 pounds of saltwater taffy at ₺20 per pound:\n   Cost = Number of Pounds * Price per Pound\n       = 16 * 20\n       = ₺320\n\n2. Calculate the discount on 5 pounds and a quarter (5.25) of salt water taffy:\n   Since we are not given an exact price for this special offer, let's call it 'x'. We know that buying these would cost you less than paying full price.\n   \n3. The total weight of the regular priced items is 16 pounds + .25 pounds = 16.25 pounds\n   So if she bought only those at normal pricing, they'd be (20 * 16) ₺320.\n   \n4. Then we have to figure out how much you would save with this special offer:\n   Since Xena scooped up a total of 23 pounds and the regular priced items were already 16.25 pounds then it means that she bought only 6.75 pounds at 'x'. That's (20 * .75) = ₺15 less than if they had been full price.\n   \n5. So, we now have to find out what x is: \n   Since the offer of buying these items for a lower cost would be worth the discount then that means 16 - (.25 + 6.75) or (16-13.00)= ₺3 must be equal to .75 * x.\n   \n   So we now have:\n    .75x = 15\n     Then divide by both sides: \n      .75*x / .75= 15/.75 \n        x =20 \n\n6. Therefore the discounted price for those items is $20 - (5 pounds * ₺3) or ($20-₺15)= $5.\n\n7. Calculate the cost of all saltwater taffy:\n   Cost = Price of full priced + Discounted\n       = 320 + (23 * 16 * .75)\n   To calculate that we have to first find out how many pounds got a discount: \n      The number of discounted items is given by 5.25.\n     Now subtract the non-discounted saltwater taffy from total:\n        Total weight - Non-Discounted Weight\n         =23 -16.25=6.75\n    Then we find out that (20 * .75) or ₺15 would be saved in buying those discounted pounds of salt water.\n\n8. So the discount on 5 and a quarter is \n   Discount amount for all discounted items: (5*3)+((.25)*3)= $18\n   \n9. Calculate the cost of all discounted taffy:\n    Cost = Total full priced + Discounted\n       = ₺15 * Number of pounds that got discounts+ Price of non-discounted saltwater taffy \n         = 6.75*20+(16-13)*3\n        Since (x) is $5 the total discounted cost would be ((1/4)(23 -16)) * price for items with a discount + Total full priced \n           Now multiply that by .25:\n             ($18)+($320)= ₺338\n\n10. Calculate the total amount spent on saltwater taffy:\n    Cost = Full Priced Taffy + Discounted Taffy\n       = 338 + (20 *16)\n         Since she bought a pound of it, then we have to multiply that by .75 to find out how much money was saved in buying those items at this offer: \n        That is ((.25)(23-16))* price for full priced taffy\n    = 338 + 320 = ₺658\n\n11. Calculate the total amount spent on starfish and keychains:\n   Cost of Star Fishes= Price per item * Number of items \n                     = ₺11.5 * 1  \n     = ₺11.50\n   Total cost for Keychain purchases is: price * number of keys purchased.\n    Cost = (Price per Key) * Number of Keys Purchased\n      = 20.75 *14\n       = ₺289\n\n12. Calculate the total amount spent on all items:\n    Total Amount Spent= Cost of Salt Water Taffy + Cost of Star Fishes and Keychains \n                    = 658+11.5+289 \n   This is equal to: \n\n13.

Next, we need to find out how much Uma has to pay for the remaining 7 kgs (22 total kgs - 15 kgs) of cotton candy:\n   - She gets a discount on these 5 kgs and then buys an extra 2kgs at full price.\n   - So first let's calculate 3kg at regular price: ₣21 * 3 = ₣63\n   - Now she pays for the discounted 5 kg of cotton candy, which is (7/15) * ₣315 \n     because it was originally part of a deal to buy 15 kgs.  \n   The value here can be calculated as follows: First find out what 1kg costs after discount.\n    That's (₣21 - ((2/3)* ₣21)) = ₣14.33 per kg\n   Now let's calculate the total cost for these discounted cotton candies:\n     (7 /15) * ₣315, this is a fraction of full price and Uma bought 7kgs.\n    This equals: 0.46*₣315 ≈ ₹144.99\n    \n3.

To find out how much Uma spent in total, we need to add up all her expenses:\n    Total cost of cotton candy + coral piece + pins \n    is $523 (for cotton) + $11.75( for the bag )+ ₣363.75(for the pin).\n   This equals: ₣897.5\n\n7.

Now let's calculate how much the normal brand costs for this amount of tea (without including the extra expensive brand and muffin):\n   Normal brand cost per day is ₣4/kilogram, \n   So a week worth would be: ₣4/kilogram * 2 kilogram/day * 7 days = ₣56\n\n4.

Therefore, the total amount of rice bought would be 1 * 7 = 7 kilograms (kg).\n3. The normal brand costs €12 per kg but since his favorite was sold out, Mohammed had to buy the more expensive one that is 25% higher in price than the regular brand.\n4. To find this increased cost, we calculate 25% of the original price: \n   - First, convert percentage into a decimal by dividing it with 100 (0.25).\n   - Then multiply €12 * 0.25 to get €3 increase per kg for the expensive rice.\n5. The new total cost is then calculated as follows:\n   Original Price + Increase in Cost\n   So that will be: \n     Regular price = €12 per kilogram,\n     Increased price = (Regular price) + (€3)\n                     =  €15 per kilogram.\n6.

The total amount of sugar used for the whole week would be: \n   - Total sugar needed = daily usage * number of days\n   - Total sugar needed = 2 kg/day * 7 days\n   - Total sugar needed = 14 kg\n\n3. Now, calculate the cost using Esteban's favorite brand:\n   - Cost = price per unit (kg) * total units used\n   - Cost for normal sugar = $20/kg * 14 kg \n   - Cost for normal sugar = $280.\n\n4. The more expensive brand is sold out and costs 10% extra than the original cost.\n   - To calculate a 10% increase: price_increase = (base_price) * (increase_percentage / 100)\n   - Increase in price of Esteban's favorite brand would be:\n     - Price increase for his preferred sugar = $20/kg * (10/100)\n     - Price increase for his preferred sugar = $2\n\n5.

He uses 2 kg of rice per day, so he will need 7 * 2 = 14 kg of rice in total.\n\nNow we have two types of rice: the normal brand and the more expensive brand. We know that the more expensive brand costs 25% more than the normal brand ($8). To find out how much it costs:\n3. First, calculate 25% of $8 (which is 0.25 * 8 = 2).\n4. Then add this amount to the cost of the normal rice: $8 + $2 = $10.\n\nSo now we know that Mateo needs to buy a total of:\n\n- Normal brand of rice for x kg and\n- More expensive brand for (14 - x) kg\n\nSince he is buying 1 week's worth of rice, in order to get the price for both types of rice. We can start by calculating how much it costs when Mateo buys all his needed rice from more expensive one.\n5. The total cost will be $10 * 14 = $140.\n\nNow let us consider a case where we buy only normal brand ($8 per kg). In this scenario, the total price would have been:\n6. (The initial step has not actually been used) $8 * 14 =$112 \n\nSince there is no other type of rice in question besides these two types that were mentioned within our given problem statement, it's clear from previous steps we only need to consider one combination which includes normal brand and the more expensive version.\n\nTherefore, comparing both prices:\n- If Mateo buys all his needed rice from more expensive brand then total price is $140.\n- But if he bought 14 kg of rice at a lower rate (normal) it would have been: ($112)\n\nMateo will choose one combination that results in the least cost. So we can just pick between two options, which were calculated above.\n\nSince Mateo wanted to buy muffin too for $4 then total price should be sum of both prices.\n7. Therefore, Total Price = (Least Cost from Two Rice Options) + ($4)\n8. From our previous calculation the least cost is $112 \n9.

First, we need to find the cost of a week's worth of rice for Arjun's normal brand.\n   - The cost per kg is $20 and he uses 2 kg per day so that will be (20 * 2) = $40 per day\n   - Since there are 7 days in a week, it would have been (40 * 7) = $280 for his favorite rice.\n\nHowever, since the more expensive brand was bought instead:\n   \n- The new cost is an increase of 20% from the original price.\n- To find this increased amount we need to calculate \n   - 20% of 20 which would be 0.2 * 20 = $4\n- So now the total cost for his favorite rice brand would have been (40 + 4) per day or 44 dollars a day.\n\nTherefore, he spends $(44*7)= $308 on that expensive rice.\n   \n3. Now we need to add this amount with an extra dollar spent by him at cookie shop\n   - Total money spent will be = 308+1=309\n\nAnswer: The final answer is $\\boxed{309}$",

The number of boys is two-sixths (or 2/6, which simplifies to 1/3) of the total number of kids minus the girls or just simply put as one-third of a value that equals both boys and unknown portion of the total number of kids because it's about \"two sixth\" being in reference directly with boys. To find out this third we must first know how many boys are there, for example, let us assume x is our total amount.\n3. So two-sixth or 2/6 equals to one-third which can be written as (1 / 3) * k = number of boy where \"k\" stands in place of unknown value that represents the remaining kids not girls since we already know there are 39 girls so it's x - 39, and this gives us: \n   Since boys represent two sixth then:\n   (2/6)*x = Number of Boys or,\n   x*(1/3) = number of boy\n4. Also if total is \"k\" which equals to both remaining kids plus the girls so k must be equal 39 + unknown.\n5. The value for this portion that we can write as, (2 /6)*x , since it's given two-sixth then,\n   (1/3) * x = Number of boy or boys\n6. Now lets use both equations together in order to solve the problem and find our \"k\" \n    First equation from step 4: k equals total kids which is girls plus unknown, so we can say that k = 39 + unknown.\n7. Since this value also must satisfy second one i.e (1/3)*x= boys,\n   So if we solve for x using both equations together then our \"k\" or the remaining amount of students not yet accounted for would give us total number of kids in field, because that is what k represents \n8. By solving this equation and putting values to it we get 39 + unknown = (total number of boys) *3 since if you solve for x from step7 using second one then,\n   Total kids = girls plus unknown value which equals two sixth or total boys.\n9. So lets plug in some numbers, since there are no variables left so now let us directly put values to it and find out the answer.\n    If we simplify (1/3)*x= number of boy using step 6 then,\n   We have k = 39 + unknown from equation 7 which equals boys * three or simply two sixth times total kids \n10. So lets plug some numbers now for x since there is no variable left to solve the problem so putting values in (1/3)*x= number of boy and using both equations together then we get:\n    Total = girls + remaining portion i.e 39+unknown\n   Since two sixth equals one third, let us put value as k * 2 /6 or simply x which is boys to first equation from step7 now so that,\n   (1/3)*x= number of boy.\n11. Let's substitute our values and find the answer:\n    If we assume total kids are \"k\" then using both equations together, \n   We get k = 39 + unknown since this value also must satisfy second equation which is boys * three or simply two sixth times total students in field,\n12. So now let us put some number to it and find out the answer.\n    Since there's no more variable left so we can just plug our values in both equations from step4,6 7 and solve for k then \n   We get k = (number of boys) * three or simply total kids which also must satisfy second one that is x=39 + unknown where \"x\" stands for remaining value i.e\n    Now putting some numbers to it since there are no more variables left now so we can plug in both values and find out the answer.\n13.

First, we need to find out how many plants Kimia can fit in her flower bed.\n   - The total length of the flower bed is 144 feet.\n   - Each plant grows 7 feet wide and requires a space for another 12 feet between them.\n   So, each group (plant + empty space) occupies: \n    - 7 (width of the plant)\n   - + 12 = 19\n   Space per plant including width is occupied.\n\n2. Now we can divide the length of flower bed by this total to find number of groups that would fit into her garden:\n   Total plants including spaces will be calculated as: \n    - 144 (total feet) / 19 (feet/ group).\n   \n3. This gives us a result with decimal numbers, but since you can't have fractions of the plant in this context we round down to get integer number that would fit into her garden.\n\n4. Given she already owns 10 flowers and now we know how many more plants will be needed:\n   We simply add those two quantities together to find total number of flowers she needs.\n   \n5. Once you have quantity, multiply it by cost per plant (¥5) \n    - ¥(cost per unit * required units)\n\nNow let's do the math:\n\n- 144 / 19 = 7.58\n   We round down this result as we can't fit fractions of plants in a garden so: \n   \n- Number of groups that will be needed is rounded to whole number:\n    - The total number of spaces including width occupied by each group.\n    \n   Now since she already owns the plant, let's calculate how many more flowers need to be bought. \n\n6. To find out the remaining quantity we subtract her existing flower bed plants from 7: \n     She will have a new requirement for another (7 -10) = -3 more plants or just remove that because it is negative as you cannot buy negative number of items.\n   Thus, she already has enough to fill up all available space in garden including the one at beginning and won't need anything else.\n\nHowever since we are required by question statement to give a numerical value for how much money will be spent (and given existing plants), let's find out her initial flower bed total area using 7 feet width of plant:\n \n- Since she can fit only whole numbers in this problem, the space is always going to end up being an even number.\n   Thus we consider her available spaces: \n\n    - A single group has a width occupied by one unit including empty spaces between two plants = 19\n\nGiven these points, let's do our calculations with existing plant count so that we can still get correct final result:\n\n- Total space she will be using to put flowers is:\n     The flower bed length of: \n    - 144 feet.\n\n7. Now divide the total available garden width by each single group (plant + empty spaces between plants) in order to find out how many groups or plant sets can fit there:\n   \n   So we get an equation with number of whole units being equal to 144 /19 \n\n8. Next, let's multiply this result by cost per flower (¥5). Since the actual space including width occupied is 19 feet for each group and since she already has plants so that her available spaces in total can be calculated using following formula:\n    - Total area = length * number of groups or plant sets.\n\n9. Now we will use division to find out how many more flowers are needed.\n   She needs (7) because there is no space left for another one as she already has 10 plants, which means that the garden can only accommodate up to a total of: \n\n    - existing_plants = 10\n   So you need 0 more units.\n\n\n\nStep by step reasoning complete.",

First, we need to find the total width of all plants in Olivia's flower bed.\n   The length of her flower bed is 165 feet and she has a space between every plant that needs to be 13.75 feet.\n\n2. Since each row will have one less plant than its number (to leave some space) so we should divide by two the spaces left for plants in this situation, because if you remove all flowers from her garden it would only take up half of what's used.\n   To calculate how many rows Olivia can fit into her flower bed: \n   Number of Flowers = 11\n   So number of empty spots between those is (165 / (13.75 + 3)) -1 \n     we subtract one to remove the extra space after last plant in every row.\n\n    Then total width of plants will be calculated as:\n    \n    Total Width Of Plants = ((Number Of Flowers * Plant Size) + ((number of rows - Number Of Flowers)*empty spots))\n   \n   After calculating number of empty spaces between flowers and removing 1 from it because there is a flower at the end that does not leave any space after itself we can calculate total width occupied by all plants.\n\n3. To find out how many more plants Olivia needs to buy:\n    Total Length Of The Bed = Number Of Flowers * (Plant Size + empty spots) \n   Since this equation will be very close and slightly less than the length of flower bed, she must have bought one extra plant for her garden which can hold its space.\n   \n4. Now let's calculate how much money Olivia spent to fill up her flower bed:\n    Number Of Additional Plants Needed = Total Length Of The Bed / (Plant Size + empty spots) - 11 \n   We subtract 11 from the total number of plants because we already know that she has bought and planted them in garden.\n\n5. Finally, let's multiply this by ₺5 to get a final answer.\n    Money Spent = Number Of Additional Plants Needed * ₺5\n\nNow performing calculations:\n\nFirst calculate how many rows can be put into the flower bed:\n   number of empty spots between flowers is 13.75 feet\n   So we have (165 / (3 + 13.75)) -1 \n     which equals to about 10.\n   \nSo total width occupied by all plants would equal to: \n\n((11 * 6) + ((9)*15))\n    = (66+135)\n    = 201\n\nNow let's calculate the number of additional plants Olivia needs:\n   Total Length Of The Bed / (Plant Size + empty spots) - Number Of Flowers \n     which is (165/16)-11 \n\nSo, we have: \n   Money Spent = ((165/16)-11)* ₺5\n   ≈ 10.5625*₺5\n\nAnswer:\nThe final answer is $52.8125",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n1. First, let's calculate the total distance that Quinn needs to cover with plants and spaces between them in her flower bed of 189 meters length.\nSince we know the width of each plant (5 meters) and space left between every plant (13.5 meters), \nwe can find out how much space will be taken by a single unit of one plant + space, which is 18.5 meters.\n\n2. Now let's divide the total flower bed length with this value to determine the maximum number of these units that Quinn can have in her flower bed:\n189 / 18.5 = 10.243 \nSince we cannot add any fractional plants in our garden, it will be best if we round down to whole numbers.\nThis means a unit (a plant + space) fits into the flowerbed exactly ten times.\n\n3. Now let's determine how many units Quinn can have with her initial flowers of 13:\nQuinn already has these 13 flowers which also occupy some space, so when adding them up we must consider their extra spaces left between.\nTherefore she will add one more plant (14th) and the required gap to reach a total of eleven plants.\n\n4. Since Quinn wants all her flower bed filled with this pattern of flowers + gaps,\nshe can have 11 units in her garden as calculated above.\n\n\n5. Now let's determine how much space these 11 units will take up:\nSince we know that each unit (a plant + gap) takes 18.5 meters, \nwe multiply the number of plants by their total length to get the flower bed coverage: \n\n- Number of units = 11\n- Each unit covers a distance equal to plant width plus space left between them = 18.5 m\n\nCoverage for all these flowers in Quinn's garden will be:\n11 * (5 + 13.5) = 11 * 18.5 meters\n\n\n6. Now let's calculate how much of the flower bed is covered by plants and gaps.\n189 / (5+13.5)=10 units fit into her total space, but since we determined that Quinn will add one more unit to fill it up,\nshe can have a maximum of eleven 18.5m long segments in this case.\n\nHowever given our previous calculation for the number of flower bed coverage was actually equaling 11 * (5+13.5)=220 and not \n189 / (5 + 13.5) =10 units since it seems we're calculating wrong here, Quinn can have at most eleven plants with their respective gaps in her garden.\n\n\n\n7. However let's correct our previous calculation where the number of unit is actually equal to:\n11 *18.5 =220 meters\n\nAnd now that we know how much space they'll cover (220 m), \nlet's calculate how many additional flowers Quinn needs.\n\nWe've calculated 10 units fit into her total garden but she can have eleven so this leaves us with\n- Number of extra spaces or plants required to fill up the flowerbed =11 - 10=1\n\n\n8. Now let's find out how much more space does these two last gaps (for Quinn’s next plant) will cover:\nEach unit is equal to a single gap between flowers plus their width which equals to\n18.5 meters and we already have ten of them in her garden, therefore the remaining space she has left after covering 10 units would be \n189 - 220 =-31.\nHowever this was incorrect since it resulted in negative number,\nit's better if we go back a step (we're allowed) to correct our earlier miscalculation. Quinn will actually have eleven segments of plant + gap which equals total length, i.e., \n11 *18.5= 205.\n\n\n\nSo the remaining space left after covering ten units would be:\n189 - 205 =-16\n\nHowever this is not a good answer since it also resulted in negative number,\nit's better if we go back one more step to correct our earlier miscalculation.\nWe have determined that Quinn has eleven segments of plant + gap which equals total length, i.e., \n11 *18.5= 205.\n\n\n\nBut let’s use another approach this time\nThe remaining space left after covering ten units would be:\n189 - (10*18.5)=2\n\nHowever we cannot divide any garden into fractions so Quinn will add one more unit to fill up her flower bed which was correct and it makes sense.\n\n\nNow that we have corrected our calculation for the number of extra spaces or plants required, \nwe know she needs 1.\n\n9. Now let's find out how many flowers are needed in total:\n- Number of flowers initially =13\n- Additional space left to cover with one more unit (plant + gap) =1\n\nTotal number of flowers Quinn will have: initial flowers + additional flower = 14\n\n\n10. Since we've determined that there will be a maximum of eleven units or plants and gaps in her garden,\nwe can",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \nTo find out how much money Aisha will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to calculate the total number of flowers she needs and multiply it by their cost.\n\nFirstly, let's determine the maximum number of plants that can be placed in a row. Since each plant is 3 meters wide and there should be a gap of 13 meters between every two plants, \nwe add 3 + 13 to get (16) total space for one plant.\nWe divide 182 by the required spacing per flower bed segment plus the width of flowers i.e.,  \n(182 / 16). Then round down since we can't have a fraction part in this case and that gives us, \n11.125 which rounds down is equal to 11.\n\nSince there are 12 rows (calculated from dividing total length by row length) possible with the spacing required for each flower plant,\nthe maximum number of flowers would be 12 * 11 = 132\n\nHowever, we need to verify that this number doesn't exceed Aisha's actual space because a larger number may not fit into her garden.\nSo let us consider other scenario. Now if there are total N plants in the bed and each plant needs (3 + spacing between two flowers) i.e., \n(16)meters of length, then we have,\nTotal Flowers = Total Length / required segment per flower\n= 182/16 which equals to eleven.\nTherefore, The number of rows would be given as follows. If there are a total 'N' plants and each needs (3 + spacing) i.e., \n(13+ 3)meters then we have,\nNumber Of Rows = Total Length / required segment per flower\n= 182/(16).\nSo the maximum possible flowers in N, will equal to 11.\n\nAisha already owns 12 flowers. We can't use this as a row but rather add it into our total plants count so \n132 + 12 - (N) which is same as adding number of rows and multiplying them by length per flower bed segment,\nequals to 144\n\nWe subtract N because we have added the owned plant in each row, i.e., 11 * required space for flowers plus width.\nNow let us add it with 132:\nTotal Flowers = Total Length / (required spacing between two plants + width of one plant)\n= Number Of Rows\nSince there are eleven rows and total length is divided by \n(16)meter. We can simply multiply the number of row i.e., \"11\" to find out how many flowers will be needed.\n\nHowever, Aisha already owns 12 plants so we must add that in our count,\nTotal Flowers = Number Of Rows + owned plant\n= 144\n\nThe cost per flower is $4 at the store. To calculate the total amount of money spent on buying more flowers to fill up her garden:\nwe multiply the number of additional flowers (total - already_owned) by their price.\nSince there are a total 'N' plants and we have added Aisha's plant in every row, i.e., 12 so \n144 - N which is same as adding each row length multiplied with number_of_rows,\nequals to 132.\n\nAdditional Flowers = Total Flowers - Already Owned\n= Number Of Rows * (required spacing between two flowers + width of one flower)\nSince there are eleven rows and total length is divided by required segment per plant i.e., \n(16)meter. We can simply multiply the number of row '11' to find out how many flowers will be needed.\nHowever, Aisha already owns 12 plants so we must add that in our count,\nAdditional Flowers = Total Length / (required spacing between two plants + width of one plant)\n= Number Of Rows\nWe have added each length for N i.e., required segment per flower bed and \nmultiplied by number_of_rows. It gives us total flowers.\nTotal cost will be given as follows:\nCost = Additional Flowers * Price Per Flower\nSince there are a total 'N' plants, we can add 12 in every row to find out how many flowers Aisha needs,\nAdditional Flowers = Number Of Rows \nSo the additional number of flowers that need to be purchased is equal to \"132\".\nTotal cost will be given as follows:\nCost = Additional Flowers * Price Per Flower\n= (Number Of Rows) * price_per_flower\nSince there are eleven rows and total length divided by required segment per plant i.e., \n(16)meter.

First, we need to find out how many plants Elena can fit in her flower bed.\n   To do this, we subtract the width of a plant (5 meters) and the space between each plant (13.0 meters), then divide that total distance by 2 since there is one less gap than number of gaps created from n items:\n   \n   Distance = Length - ((Width + Gap)*n)\n   \n   Here 'Length' equals to 182, 'width plus a gap' in this context will be the plant width (5) added with its space between it and other plants i.e. 13+5=18m,\n   'N', or number of items/gaps is equal to total no. of flowers she has +1 since gaps are created by every item, hence n equals to Elena's current flower count plus one.\n   \n2. We plug in the numbers into our equation:\n   Distance = 182 - (5+13)*10\n   \n3. Solving for 'n':\n   (18 * 9) is equal to (162)\n   So we do: \n   182-162 equals 20\n\n4.

Next, let's find the remaining space left after placing all those flowers:\n   \n   Distance left for more plant placements is not required to solve this problem.\n6. Since there are already some plants (10), Elena needs one more set of 9 spaces i.e., between existing flower bed and a gap from next potential or last possible planting point.\n7. Therefore, we can fit another 8 flowers in the remaining space because she has 1 less plant than needed to fill her garden completely.\n\n8. So now let's add all plants:\n   Total no of required new plants = 10 +9 (required for each existing gap) \n   \n9. To find total number of plants: Elena already owns one set and we have added another, so it becomes total_plants_owned+plants_needed_for_remaining_space\n    Therefore the equation is : total_plant_required= 10+9\n   \n   Now calculate this,\n   Total plant required =19\n\n10.

Next, let's find out how many sets of this pattern will fit in Priya's flower bed.\n   The length of the flower bed is 175 feet long and each set takes up 14.5 feet wide so:\n   Number of plants that can be accommodated = (length of flowerbed / space per plant)\n = (175 / 14.5) \n ≈ 12.\n\n3.

First, we need to find out how many seats are available for guests in the gymnasium after accounting for graduate and faculty seats.\n   Available seats = Total capacity - Graduate seats - Faculty seats\n                 = 7300 - 550 - 150\n                 = 6600\n\n2. Since tickets will be split equally among graduates, we need to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive if the remaining available seats are given as tickets.\n\n3. As there is no information on total number of students graduating (i.e., 'n'), and also since it was mentioned that tickets were \"split equally\" which implies a division operation - let us assume that we want to know the ticket amount for each graduate in terms of whole numbers only.\n   Therefore, if available seats are 6600 then the possible scenario is when n graduates attend. If this 'n' value will be such as it can divide evenly into 6600.\n\n4. We need to find factors of 6600 which would help us determine how many tickets each graduate could receive.\n\n\n5. Calculating prime factorization for number 6600:\n   Prime Factor: \n        = 2 × 2 (squared)  \n        = 3\n        = 11^2\n6.

Now since we have total of 550 graduates and available seats for guests are 6600 then each graduate can get tickets which will be as follows:\n    If n=1, then ticket amount = 6600\n    if n is a factor that divides evenly into 6600 with quotient greater than 5 then it's acceptable.\n\n8. Considering the highest possible ticket distribution (i.e., when we have lowest 'n' value) and considering all factors of available seats in order from smallest to largest, then tickets per graduate would be calculated as follows:\n   if n = factor where this will divide evenly into 6600 with quotient greater than or equal to 1 \n      Tickets_per_graduate = 6600/n\n9. In our scenario we have following lowest possible value of 'n' (as factors) such that it meets the conditions in step-8:\n   n=100, therefore tickets per graduate would be as follows: 66\n\n10.

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \n\n1. First, we need to find the total number of seats available for guests (friends and family). This is calculated by subtracting the seats reserved for graduates and faculty from the total capacity.\n2. Available seats = Total capacity - Graduates' seats - Faculty's seats\n3. Available seats = 4800 - 900 - 300\n\nNow, let's do the calculation:\nAvailable seats = 3600 (by performing subtraction)\n\n4. Since we want to split tickets equally among graduates and they have reserved seats too, \nwe should subtract their number of reserved seats as well from available space before giving them any tickets.\n5. We now need to calculate how many guests will be left after reserving a seat for each graduate.\n\n6. Available seats = 3600 - Number of Graduates (because we are going to give one ticket per guest)\n7. Let's denote the number of graduates as 'N'. \n8. Then, N * Tickets_per_Graduate + Reserved Seats for Faculty and Graduate Students will be equal or less than total available space\n   i.e., 3600 >= Number of Graduates (G) x Ticket to Give per Guest + G + F.\n9. We know the value of 'F' which is 300.\n\n10. Since, N * Tickets_per_Guest + Reserved Seats for Faculty and Graduate Students will be equal or less than total available space,\n    we can write:\n   3600 >= Number of Graduates (G) x Ticket to Give per Guest + G + F\n11. Now, let's assume each graduate gives the same number of tickets 'T'. \n12. So now our inequality becomes:  \n    N * T <= Total available space - Reserved Seats for Faculty and Graduate Students.\n   i.e., 3600 >= Number of Graduates (G) x Ticket to Give per Guest + G.\n\n13. Since we do not have the number of graduates, let's denote 'N' as unknown value.\n14. We know that every graduate needs one seat reserved plus a ticket for each guest they are giving out\n    i.e., N * T + Number of Graduates (G) = Total available space - Reserved Seats for Faculty \n   or equivalently:\n       3600 >= G x Ticket to Give per Guest + G\n\n15. If 'T' is the number of tickets that can be given by a graduate, then each guest will get one ticket and we have: N * T <= 3600\n16. We also know there are reserved seats for faculty members which need not be considered here.\n17. Since graduates also occupy some space (seats), so let's subtract the total number of people occupying seats from available seats in gymnasium to find out how many guests can attend.\n\n18. Now, we'll solve this by assuming that each graduate gets one ticket and divide 3600 - N among G \n   which is equivalent to solving for T = Tickets given per Guest\n\n19. Let's assume the number of graduates as 'N'. \n\n20. Then our problem now becomes finding the maximum value of tickets that can be distributed if we know total available seats, reserved graduate seats and faculty members.\n\n21. From step 18: \n   We need to divide (3600 - N) by Number of Graduates(G). This is because each guest will get one ticket\n      i.e., Tickets_per_Guest = Total_tickets_for_guests / G\n\n22. Now let's consider the case where we do not know how many tickets can be given per graduate.\n\n23. Then, from our inequality equation:\n   (3600 - N) >= Number of Graduates(G) * Ticket_to_distribute + 300\n24. The problem becomes finding a relation between 'T' and 'N'. We see that the left hand side is fixed at 3300 for all possible values \n   i.e., tickets to distribute among guests = (3600 - N).\n25. Therefore, we can equate right-hand sides of inequalities from steps:23 and 20.\n\n26. Now our problem simplifies:\n    Number_of_Guests x Ticket_to_distribute + G >= Total_seats_for_guests\n27. Also, since each guest gets one ticket,\n   Tickets_per_Guest = (Total_tickets_for_guests) / N\n\n28. Therefore from equations: 20 and step :26 we get \n      N * T <= 3600 - Number of Graduates(G)\n29. From steps:23,24 the equation becomes:\n    Total_seats_for_guests >= G x Ticket_to_distribute + G\n30. Since each guest gets one ticket so Tickets_per_Guest = (Total_tickets_for_guests) / N.\n31. Therefore from equations 26 and step :20 we get \n   N * T <= Total available space - Reserved Seats for Faculty\n\n32. To find 'T' which is number of tickets per graduate, let's assume",

Emma finds three times as many as James, so she finds 3 * 5 = 15 eggs.\n4. Benjamin finds 3 less than Emma, so he finds 15 - 3 = 12 eggs.\n5. Olga finds a quarter (1/4) of the number that Benjamin found, which is 12 / 4 = 3 eggs.\n6. To find out how many eggs are still hidden in total we add up all the eggs that were taken: \n    James's + Emma's + Benjamin's + Olga's\n   = 5 (James') + 15 (Emma) + 12 (Benjamin's) + 3 (Olga's)\n   We can also use addition for these numbers to find out how many eggs they found in total.\n7.

First, let's find out how many carrots Sophia can peel in 11 minutes since it takes her some time to saute the carrots as well.\n   She peels 6 carrots per minute and she has 11 minutes for this task.\n   \n2. Multiply the number of carrots peeled by a minute (which is 6) with the total amount of minutes available, which is 11:\n    6 * 11 = 66\n\n3. Since Sophia can saute 45 carrots in those same 11 minutes and we have calculated that she peels 66 carrots during this time frame,\n   it means that for all 90 carrots (which includes the peeled as well), it will take her a bit more than just these 11 minutes.\n\n4. Let's calculate how many carrots Sophia can saute in one minute:\n    She has sauted 45 carrots over 11 minutes.\n    Divide number of carrots by total amount of time: \n    45 / 11 = approximately 4.09 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\n5. Multiply the calculated rate at which she peels/sautes a carrot per minute, with total desired outcome:\n   First, let's consider sauteing all of those carrots in one go and then we'll add time needed for peeling them.\n    The result would be 90 / (4.09) = approximately 22\n\n6. It will take her around the calculated minutes to only peel/saute these carrots at that rate, however this does not account for the extra step of first peeling all those carrots.\n\n7. Let's now add time it takes her just to peel them:\n   As we know from our calculations earlier she can peel 66 in eleven and has a target number which is slightly less than twice as many: \n    If she needs only another minute or two more, this would still fit within the calculated range of peeling/sauteing all carrots at once.",

    "logic_problem": {
      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. Nadia can peel 14 mushrooms a minute, so to find the time it takes for her to peel x mushrooms, we divide x by 14.\n\n2. To saute y mushrooms in 17 minutes at a rate of 20 mushrooms per 17 minutes, we first need to calculate how many mushrooms she can saute in one minute: \n   (y / ((y/20) * 17)) = 1\n   We are trying to solve for the time it takes her. This will result in y being equal to (20*17)/x and so is a constant, meaning that no matter how many mushrooms she has to saute we can divide by this number of minutes.\n\n3. To peel and saute x mushrooms, let's say peeling 140-x mushrooms for some unknown time 'a', and then sautéing the remaining (x) mushrooms in an unknown amount of time 'b'. The total time will be a + b.\n   We know that Nadia can peel y mushrooms per minute so she would need to take x/14 minutes or more, but we don't have this information yet.\n\n4. To saute 140-x mushrooms takes the same amount of time as it does for her to sauté 1 mushroom multiplied by (x-0) = b.\n   We also know from step two that a constant number of minutes is required regardless of how many she has left, so this will always equal x/20*17.\n\n5. To find the total amount of time we add steps three and four together to get our final equation for 't': t= (140-x)/14 + 17x/20.\n   However since peeling is a process that happens at a constant rate, there must be some minimum value of x so that this expression can actually equal the total amount of time. The best candidate would then be when Nadia only has to peel one mushroom and sauté none (i.e., 140 -x =0). This gives us t=10.\n\n6. At this point it's clear we need a way for x to grow large, but also small enough so that peeling doesn't become impractically slow. Therefore the value of 't' when Nadia has peeled one mushroom and sautéed none will be our final answer.\n   This is because if she only had 1 more mushroom then it would take her an extra minute to peel, but this wouldn’t actually help us solve for how long peeling takes (because there’s no upper limit), however in order to make the process faster and therefore give a better estimate we can try setting x equal to one less than our target of y mushrooms. This way when Nadia only has 1 mushroom left then it will take her an extra minute, but this won’t actually help us solve for how long peeling takes (because there’s no upper limit), however in order to make the process faster and therefore give a better estimate we can try setting x equal to one less than our target of y mushrooms. \n\n7. Since Nadia needs at least 14 minutes to peel all of them, this is already larger then t =10 that she needed when there was only 1 mushroom left.\n   Therefore the best candidate would be if Nadia peeled and sautéed x=140-13 or a total number of mushrooms equal to 127.\n\n8. In order for us to calculate how long it takes her, we will simply put this value into our equation from step five: \nt = (140 - 127)/14 + 17*127/20.\nWe can then plug in the numbers and solve:\nt=13/14+2163/20\n   t=(2600-3648) /420 \n    t=-1048 /420 \n\n9. We know that Nadia needs at least x =140 minutes to peel all of them, but this is already larger than our answer from step 7.\nTherefore the best candidate would be if she peeled and sautéed a total number equal to (127*14 +20) or more.\n\n10. Since peeling mushrooms takes longer then it does to saute them we can safely say that Nadia will take at least x=140+17-1 =156 minutes, since this is the smallest possible value of time she could possibly need.\n   In order for us to calculate how long it would actually take her to peel and sauté all 140 mushrooms, we simply plug in the numbers into our equation from step five:\nt=(140/14)+17*140/20\nwe can then solve this: \n   t=10+119 \n    The total time for Nadia is equal to 129 minutes.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is $\\boxed{129}$.",

    "logic_problem": {
      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \n1. First, let's find out how many mushrooms Kayla can peel per minute and saute per 14 minutes.\n   - She peels 5 mushrooms a minute.\n   - In 14 minutes, she would be able to peel (5 * 14) = 70 mushrooms.\n\n2. Now we need to determine her rate of mushroom preparation in total for both actions combined since it's given that sauteing is done with the same set of mushrooms being peeled by Kayla at a different time frame than peeling alone.\n   - We can see from above she could peel up to 70 but only needs 180. And, we know her rate when peeling which would be needed for both actions in order to make calculations possible.\n\n3. Since it is given that sauteing takes 14 minutes and Kayla wants a total of (peeled + sautéed) mushrooms = 180\n   - It seems reasonable to calculate how many sets she needs, since we know the time taken by peeling one set as well.\n   \n4. In order for her to peel 70 mushrooms which is the rate at which peels are done in 14 minutes and then sauté them all, let's find out what it will take if there were only a need of doing that task once:\n   - Since she needs (peeled + sauteed) = 180. And has peeled or can peel up to the rate of 70 mushrooms for each set\n   We are trying to figure how many times in order to do this.\n\n5. Therefore we get our number by dividing total mushroom count that is needed, which will be done with peeling and sautéing together (i.e., the task) - so if she has a rate of 70 for one set:\n   - We have to divide it into sets as many times as possible until getting enough mushrooms i.e. in this case we would need total = 180 / 70\n\n6. This is an approximation since peeling and sautéing are separate processes that can't be exactly synchronized, however if the question wants you just do a number then follow these steps.\n   - Doing so:\n     (peeled + sauteed) mushrooms needed for both actions = total set * rate of one mushroom action \n   \n7. This would lead to finding how many times we need peeling or sautéing 70 in order get our goal which will be done with following a simple division equation.\n   - Therefore:\n     (total / each_set)\n     \n8. Since it is said that mushrooms are peeled at the rate of 5 per minute and also she can prepare another set for sauteeing after every one set i.e., peeling has to wait while sautéing happens \n    this makes sense to divide total number of mushroom required by a factor which represents combined rate - so we could do (total / each_set). However, here in our case there is an additional condition that she only can prepare up to the maximum amount possible for both peeling and sauting action\n   The best way would be to calculate it using the actual time needed if you have a fixed total of 180 mushrooms so that we could make use of her combined rate which has been given in this question i.e., peeling at one end (5/min) while other is being prepared for cooking.\n   \n9. We will follow our equation - by plugging numbers into it:\n   - time_taken = ((total_mushrooms / total_set))\n     where, we would be calculating the combined rate of peeling and sautéing that Kayla can do together at one point in order to make her task easier.\n\n10. Let's calculate how long she will take by substituting given values:\n    - We know from previous steps: \n      - total_set = 70 mushrooms\n    Therefore, we could say the time it takes for this process is calculated as follows and that is equal to ((180 / 70))\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 2.57",

    },
    "logic_problem": {
      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \n1. Uma can peel 5 clams a minute, so to peel 140 clams it will take her:\n   Time = Number of Clams / Rate per Minute\n         = 140 clams / 5 clams/minute\n         = 28 minutes.\n2. To saute 35 clams in 18 minutes means she can saute at a rate of:\n   Rate per minute = Total Clams / Time \n                   = 35 clams / 18 minutes (for sauting)  \n3. Now, to find the time it takes her to sauté and peel all 140 clams, let's first calculate how many sets of peeling she can do in that 28 mins:\n   Since Uma can only peel for 28 mins, we don't need to consider anything beyond this duration.\n4. She can complete a full set (peel + saute) by spending the initial 18 minutes on one clam. Now let's find out how many such sets she needs in total: \n    Number of Clams / Rate per minute for peeling and then multiply that by time it takes to peel them\n5. In each complete cycle, Uma can only process a maximum number of clams equaling 35 (as seen from the rate provided) as she has limited sauté capacity.\n6. Let’s now determine how many such cycles are needed for peeling: \n   Cycles = Number of Clams / Rate per minute\n          = 140/5   \n         = 28\n\nSince we know that Uma needs to make a complete set (peel + saute) and she can peel at the rate mentioned. Since, time is fixed at 18 minutes for peeling clams and so the calculation of the number of full sets will be\n7. Number of Clam Sets = Total Time / Set Duration \n                      = 28 mins/18 min (for peeling + sauté)\n8. She can process a maxiumum of one set every time it takes her to peel these clams, given that she only has limited capacity in terms of how much she could actually saute within the timeframe provided.\n\n9. The number of complete sets is 1 as Uma needs an equal amount of peeling and sauting for each clam processed.\n10. Since we know this rate (35 clams), let's now find out if it matches with our calculation above: \n    Total Clam Sets = Number of Complete Cycles * Rate per Cycle\n                   = 28 cycles* 1 set/cycle \n                   \n\n11. The total number of sets that Uma can make is indeed equal to the cycle count which makes sense as she needs a complete peeling and saute time.\n12. We now know, Uma has an additional capacity left unutilized from this calculation but in order to get our final answer we need to just use it for its face value.\n\n13. Since each set can hold 35 clams (given the rate mentioned), \n    Total Clams Processed = Number of Sets * Rate per Set\n                         = 28 sets* 35 clam/set\n\n\n14. The calculation gives us a total number that is very close to our initial target which indeed matches as this would be a natural limit.\n\n15. It seems we might not need any further steps since the question already contains all relevant information and Uma’s capacity should suffice for processing these clams in accordance with her rate.\n\nAnswer: \nThe final answer is 28",

Umar collects garbage from all three places twice a week, so we need to find out how many times he'll collect in total.\n   Collections_in_a_week_from_all_places = (450+450) x 2 + 1080 x 2 \n   This simplifies to : (900 * 2 ) + (1080*2).\n   \n5. That's: 1800 + 2160.\n\n6. So that is equal to: 3960\n\n7. Finally, Umar gets paid ₣0.45 per collection for each apartment.\n   Therefore, we multiply the number of collections with his payment amount\n    Money_per_collection = (₣0.45) x (Collections_in_a_week_from_all_places)\n    \n8. The money he makes in a week is then calculated as:\n   Umar_money_made = 3960 * ₣0.45\n\nAnswer: \nThe final answer is $1782.",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n1. First, we need to find the total number of apartments in the first 4 complexes.\n   - There are 5 complexes with 350 apartments each (except for one), so: \n     Complexes_1_to_4 = Number_of_complexes * Apartments_per_complex\n      Complexes_1_to_4 = 4 * 350\n\n2. Now, calculate Complexes_1_to_4.\n   - Complexes_1_to_4 = 1400 apartments.\n\n3. The last complex is 70% bigger than the other 4 combined (Complexes_1_to_4), \n   so we need to find its size first: Size_of_last_complex = (1 + 0.7) * Complexes_1_to_4.\n   - Since it's an increase of 70%, we add that as a decimal and then multiply by the number of apartments in the other complexes.\n\n4. Calculate the size of last complex:\n   - Size_of_last_complex = 1.7 * 1400\n     Size_of_last_complex = 2380\n\n5. Now, find total number of apartments: Total_apartments = Complexes_1_to_4 + Size_of_last_complex.\n   - This will give us the overall size.\n\n6. Calculate the total:\n   - Total_apartments = 1400 + 2380\n     Total_apartments = 3780\n\n7. Ravi collects garbage from each complex 5 times a week and gets paid ¥0.5 per collection for each apartment, \n   so we need to find out his weekly earnings: Weekly_earnings_per_complex = (Number_of_collections * Price_per_collection) * Apartments_in_complex.\n   - Multiply number of collections by price per collection then multiply that result with the total apartments.\n\n8. Calculate the weekly earnings:\n   - First calculate the amount earned for one complex in a week\n     Weekly_earnings_one_complex = 5 * ¥0.5 * 350 \n       Weekly_earnings_one_complex = ¥875 \n\n9. Now, since we know Ravi has to do this five times (once from each), multiply by total complexes.\n   - Total_weekly_earnings_all_apartments = Number_of_complexes * Weekly_earnings_one_complex\n     However for his job he is doing it 5 time a week so that needs to be factored in, which will look like this:\n      Total_weekly_earnings_Ravi = (Number_of_complexes) * (Weekly_earnings_per_collection_for_each_complex)\n       Weekly earnings from all the complexes multiplied by how many times per weeks he collects\n\n10. Calculate total weekly earning.\n    - Multiply ¥875 for one complex with 5 collections a week to find out his rate per collection, then multiply that result by number of apartment places\n      Total_weekly_earnings_Ravi = (¥0.50 * 350) * 5 * Number_of_complexes\n        Since all other values are known we can plug them in now.\n       ¥875 * 5\n\n11. Now calculate total:\n    - This is equal to: \n     Weekly earnings of Ravi's job per week with the numbers inserted would be as follows.\n   Total_weekly_earnings_Ravi = (¥0.50) * ¥350 * 5\n      Then since he collects from all five complexes we can multiply by number_of_complexes, however this value is already taken into account in the calculation above.\n\n12. Calculate total weekly earnings:\n    - Weekly earnings per collection: \n     Ravis_weekly_earnings = ¥875\n\n13.

Next, we'll find out how many more apartments are there in the last complex compared to the other two combined.\n   The total for all three is going to be a little over one and half times that number because it's 20% bigger than both of them added together:\n   For every hundred units you add twenty percent - which can also be expressed as (100 + 0.2 * 100), we get 120.\n3. Now, let’s calculate the total apartments for all three complexes combined and then find out how many more are there in the last complex compared to both of them:\n   Total = (400) x 1.5 \n         = 600\n4. The extra number of apartment units in the third block is going to be what's left after removing the first two blocks' total from this final value, which can also be expressed as: 600 - 400.\n    Extra apartments = 200\n\nNow we know that there are a total of (Extra + First Two) or 200+ 400= 600 units in all three apartment complexes. \n5.

So now let’s do this calculation:\n   - Total number of apartments: 2000\n     Payment per collection for each apartment = ₺0.45.\n   We know how many times he collects trash from those places; so we can multiply it together to get total pay as follows:\n    - Collections in a week (for all) = Number of complexes * collections/complex/week: 5 *2\n      Total payment for one collection is thus, then just the number above multiplied by how many times he collects.\n   Payment per week from each place will be: \n     ₺0.45 * 10 collections in a week (for all) = ₺4.50\n   Therefore to get final total we multiply that with the amount of places there is:\n    - Total weekly payment for one collection per complex: ₺0.45, and number of complexes he works at is five.\n     Weekly pay then can be found out by multiplying those values together like this:\n      4.50 * 5 = 22.50",

The formula for the area of a rectangle is Area = Length × Width (or A = lw). Since we have the length and need to find the width, rearrange this equation to solve for w: w = A/l\n3. First convert yards into feet because the problem asks us about perimeter in feet; 1 yard equals 3 feet so a room of 5 yards is 15 feet.\n4. Substituting our known values into the formula from step 2, we get width (w) as follows: w = A / l \n   Here we have:\n   - Area(A) equal to 465 square feet\n   - Length(l), which in this case equals length of room, is 15 feet.\n5.

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to convert the length of Bodhi's room from yards to feet because there are two different units involved in this problem.\n   Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet (yard = 3 * foot), \n   then 10 yards will be equal to (10) * (3).\n   \n2. The area of a rectangle can also be calculated by multiplying its length and width, so we need another variable representing the room's width.\n   Since the problem states that Bodhi has an office with an area of 930 square feet and we already know one dimension is 30 feet long,\n   then to find out what his other side would have been: Area = Length * Width. Therefore, (10) * (3) yards or length equals 30 feet.\n   \n   To calculate the room's width in feet, given its area as 930 square feet and its known length of 30 feet:\n   So we can simply divide both sides by one dimension to find out what would be another: Width = Area / Length. \n   Therefore (Width) will equal 930/30.\n   \n3. To get the perimeter of Bodhi's office, we need two variables representing each side and multiply them together with an additional step that adds all four dimensions once more in order for you to calculate total length around rectangle - P = 2(length + width). \n   So first let us convert our given data back into feet: Length is (10 * 3) which equals thirty. Then Width will equal ((930 /30)).\n   \n4. Now we have all of the dimensions represented in a consistent unit system that matches what's required by problem statement - perimeter calculation:\n    Given Bodhi has an office whose length was originally given as ten yards but converted into feet it became  (10 *3)= thirty.\n    Width equals ((930 /30)) which simplifies down to thirty-one point zero over three or a little more than ten. \n   To get the total of each side, we'll just multiply these two numbers together and add them once again - that gives us: P = 2(length + width).\n   \n5. This will give you your answer after substituting values from above equations into formula for perimeter calculation:\n    P= (two * ((ten) + thirty-one point zero three)).\n\nStep by step math calculations:\n\n- First, we need to convert length in yards to feet: \n   Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet,\n     so the given data will become - Length = 30 and Width equals ninety-three over three. Then\n   P= (two * ((ten) + thirty-one point zero three)).\n   \n- Now, let's do our math step-by-step:\n    First we'll convert both numbers into decimal form for easier multiplication later on: \n     So ten becomes 10 and Thirty one-point-zero three equals thirty-one-and-three tenths. Next,\n   We have P = (two * ((ten) + thirty-one point zero three)) which is equal to\n      two times fifteen plus sixty-two over tens.\n   \n- Now we multiply the values inside of those parentheses first: \n     That will give us sixteen-point-zero and also an extra six-tenths. Then,\n   We have P = (two * (16-and-six tenths)).\n    \n- Lastly, now that both numbers are in decimal form with same denominator - 10,\n    we can simply multiply them together without having to add or convert anything else: \n      two times sixteen point zero equals thirty-two and six-tenths.\n   And since the original question asks what is perimeter of Bodhi's rectangular office in feet, then\n   Our final answer must be represented as just a number - The decimal form will need to get converted into its simplified fraction equivalent before being given out.\n\nStep by step reasoning: ...\n\nTo calculate two times sixteen point zero equals thirty-two and six-tenths \nwe can express it mathematically as 2 * (16.6).\n\nTherefore, the result of this expression is equal to\n   Thirty-and-six tenths or simply written in decimal form - twenty-three-and-four tenth's simplified fraction equivalent will be: Thirty two plus point-zero six equals thirty-two and zero point six.\n\nNow that we have it converted back into its simplest fractional notation,\nour next step should involve expressing the number as just a single digit like originally required by problem statement.\nThis means finding an integer value for numerator (numerator) so when divided through common denominator 'ten', yields only whole numbers left over - no more decimal places present!\nIn order words find greatest common divisor between thirty-two and six which would equal their product i.e., \nthe greatest number possible dividing evenly into both without leaving remainder.\nThat leaves us with final result represented solely by integer part since there aren't any leftovers from previous division operation performed above:\nwhich turns out to be   (32+6)/10 = 38/10.",

We are also told that there's an alternative unit (yards) used so we need to convert it first: since one yard equals three feet then eight yards equal twenty-four feet because of this equation - 1 * 8 = 24\n3. With the length in feet and area given, we can now calculate width by using the formula for finding a rectangle's area which is Area = Length x Width.\n4. Rearrange to solve for Width: Width = Area / Length \n5. Substitute values into this rearranged equation with known variables - 1128 square feet divided by twenty-four (the length in feet) equals forty-seven point four seven five six or more precisely, when rounded that's approximately \"47\".\n6. Now we know the width and have been given a different unit for one side of our room so to calculate perimeter which is P = 2 * L + 2 * W where L means Length (24 feet) and W stands for Width then substitute these known values.\n7. With this formula, plug in \"L\" as twenty-four and the width as forty-seven point four seven five six or more accurately when rounded up to a whole number that is '47'.\n8. Plug those numbers into our perimeter equation P = 2 * L + W for both sides then solve it out: \n    (P) = [24*2] + [47]\n    That results in the calculation:\n        (P)=48+47\n9.

Lastly, daisies are sold for ₣6.40 per bundle which rounds down to $6 since it's less than half.\n\nNow that Oscar has his prices in dollars he can calculate the total amount of money made from selling 14 bundles of roses ($2.59 * 14), \n27 bundles of sunflowers ($4 * 27) and finally, for daisies: 39 bundles at a price of $6 each.\nThen we sum these three amounts to get our answer.\n\nNow let's plug in the numbers:\n- Total amount from rose sales = $2.59 * 14\n= $36.26\n\n- The total from sunflower sales is found by multiplying their new rounded price ($4) with how many bundles were sold (27).\n   This gives us: \n$4 * 27 = $108 \n\n- Lastly, for daisies we multiply the number of daisy bundles that Oscar sells to him ($6 per bundle): \n39*6 =$234\n\nFinally summing all these amounts together:\nTotal money made by Oscar is found as follows\n   Total Money=36.26 + 108+234 = $378.26 \n\nSo, rounding down for accuracy (since he has no change and we don't want to give more than what was earned in this context) the final amount of money that will be received would be:\n$378\n\nAnswer: The final answer is $\\boxed{378}$.",

The price for orchids (¥1.26) rounded down is ¥1 and up is ¥2; it rounds down because 0.26 < 0.5.\nThe price for roses (¥2.79) rounded down is ¥2 and up is ¥3, but since we are rounding to the nearest whole number dollar from a value that is greater than .50 this will round to $3.\n\nThe price of lilies ($6.4) rounds down because 0.40 < 0.5; it's $6.\nNow let’s calculate how much Kai made:\n- He sold 15 baskets of orchids for ¥1 per basket, so he earned (15 * ¥1 = ¥15).\n- He sold 15 baskets of roses for ¥3 per basket, but since we're calculating in dollars and his prices are now rounded to $3 from the original value it should be noted that this is incorrect; however using the original price as a guide which was $2.79 then rounding up (to $3) based on that: 15 *$3 = $45.\n- He sold 39 baskets of lilies for ¥6 per basket, so he earned (39 * ¥6 = ¥234).\nNow we add these values to find the total amount Kai made:\n¥15 + $45 is actually just a combination error in explanation not math; the value should be left as dollars and added with other dollar amounts. Therefore it's 15 + 45.\nThen adding this result (60) plus the remainder of his lily earnings after conversion, we get: ¥234 converted to dollars = approximately $2.93 *39 baskets but again rounding up from that original price is actually around 6.4 and converting those values into their dollar form would give us more than .50 so it should be rounded as such; the result of this will be (7) \nThus, we get: ¥234 converted to dollars = approximately $2.93 *39 baskets but since rounding up from that original price is actually around 6.4 and converting those values into their dollar form would give us more than .50 so it should be rounded as such; the result of this will be (7).

The price for orchids is ¥1 and up is $2 but it rounds down because 0.26 < 0.5 so he earned (15 * ¥1 = ¥15).\nHe sold roses at a value that was originally in yen converted into dollars rounded up from original: which should be noted as such; using the correct rounding of values, his price for rose is $3 per basket and since we're working with dollar amounts now let’s calculate how much he made from it. He earned (15 *$3 = $45).\nHe sold lilies at a value that was originally ¥6 converted to dollars rounded up: which should be noted as such; using the correct rounding of values, his price for lily is $7 per basket and since we're working with dollar amounts now let’s calculate how much he made from it. He earned (39 *$7 = 273).\nNow we add these values to find the total amount Kai made: ¥15 + $45 is actually just a combination error in explanation not math; the value should be left as dollars and added with other dollar amounts so then adding this result of calculation (60) plus the remainder of his lily earnings after conversion, we get:\nThus, 273 + 60 \nAnswer: The final answer is $\\boxed{333}$.",

This means that if we add this number of black paint tubes (one tube in this case, as it's equal to one-seventh of the total) to Benjamin's black paint collection and subtracting from Jamal's since he has more: \n   However for simplicity let us just calculate how much less is there with benjamin then jamal so we can use that later. We now know 7-1 = 6\n\n4. The other part tells us, Benjamin also has two times as many tubes of orange paint than Jamal's eight.\nSo if you multiply the number of black paint (which was 8) by a factor of 2:\n   This will give: \n   So it is actually just doubling since multiplication means to add for each integer in this case and we have one so its really simple. The correct calculation here would be then simply : 8 *2 =16\n\n5. Now that we know Jamal has six less black paint tubes than Benjamin (6) but also twice as much orange paint, \n   To find out how many total number of paint he had to begin with: add these two numbers together\n    Since Jamal does not have the same amount of each color and his collection is 7 +8 =15.\n   \nTo get Benjamins final answer we'll use a simple formula from above in step5. We now know that \n   if benjamin has 6 more black paint tubes than he actually does, but twice as much orange: so to find out how many of each color and add them up together:\n    For Black paint it would be :15 -6 =9.\n     For Orange paint we already figured this one in step4 which is simply doubling the number of colors that Jamal has (8 *2= 16).\n    \n   To get Benjamins final answer: \n    We'll take what we found out earlier for each color and add them up:\n    So total tubes = black + orange\n       Total Tubes =9+16\n\n6.

First, let's calculate how many tubes of indigo paint Kai has:\nSince Kai has 2/4 as many tubes of indigo paint as Leon and there are 18 tubes with Leon,\nKai has (2/4) * 18 = 9 tubes.\n\nHowever this is incorrect because to get the value of two fourths, we should do it like so: \ntwo-fourths equals 0.5 or fifty percent which means kai must have half as many indigo paint tubes.\nSince Kai only needs to have a half amount (not fractions) he will need 9/2 = four and a half but since you can't buy that much of the product, we round down because in real life this is how it would be done. \nSo kai must then really just have nine halves which means one has been removed to make him able to afford the paint so he actually needs 9/2 =4 and a half but since you can't buy that much of something you take away four tubes because if you had only taken one tube it wouldn’t be half, right? \nNow we are at nine halves which is almost exactly five. No this isn’t what I said in the last sentence so let’s go back to where we left off: kai must have a little less than 9 of paint but that was an error on my part; since you cannot buy paint by halving it, one tube has been taken away because if only half were removed he would then not be able to afford the product. \nNow let’s move forward.\nHe will actually need nine halves and take four tubes so kai must have 5 (since five is roughly equal to four point five).\nSo that means since we found out Kai needs exactly, or almost precisely five paint tubes for indigo he now has this many of these.\n\n2. Next, let's calculate how many tubes of red paint Kai has:\nSince Kai has eight times as many tubes of red paint as Leon and there are 7 tubes with Leon,\nKai has (8 * 7) = 56 tubes.\n\nHowever that isn’t correct because when you multiply by eight the answer will be sixty four.\nSo he actually needs this much indigo in order to have his red one, since I just told you what was incorrect and what wasn't so let’s continue with our solution here now:\nSince kai has an 8 times multiplier on top of him for each tube that is used as a base number. This means if there are seven tubes he will need eight sets which equals sixty four.\n\nTherefore Kai must have this many indigo paint in order to have his red one: \nNow let’s calculate how much total amount of paint does kai has\nTo do so we add the two together:\nKai now needs 5 (indigo) + 64 = 69 tubes.\n\n\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 69.",

To calculate this extra amount:\n   - The difference in percentage is always based on the current value (the nickel pickaxe) for these kind of problems.\n     So we first need to find out how much ore would be mined if it was only an increase by 70% and then add that back into our previous result\n   . To calculate a 70% increase, multiply the original number by this percentage in decimal form (0.7):\n   - The extra amount = 10 * 0.7 = 7 kg.\n\n2. Add this to what he mines with nickel pickaxe:\n    Extra ore mined per day using titanium: \n     total_ore_mined_per_day_with_titanium_pickaxe = original_amount + increase_in_percentage\n     total_ore_mined_per_day_with_titanium_pickaxe = 10 kgs/day (nickel) + 7 kgs/day (70% of the nickel amount)\n    So he mines 17 kg per day using a titanium pickaxe.\n\n3.

Multiply this by the total number of workers given in the question.\n     - Monthly Production for all miners: \n        Since we have determined our daily ore output to equal about 338, multiply it now by how many days are typically in a month (which is used as an approximation).\n   We need monthly production:\n    - Total miner usage and work days = number of workers * days worked per worker\n      Which would be: \n        Number of Workers given was \"26\"\n          Days in the Month given were approximately 28.\n         Monthly Production equals ore mined daily for one person multiplied by how many people are working that day times the total amount of time those same miners will work each month (we can just use days because we know, and it is easier to do so).\n        In this case:\n            - Ore Mined per Day * number of workers given in problem = 338 pounds/day\n              Times the Month Days.

Calculate the remaining water in this mixture (the spilled part was all water since it's an aqueous solution):\n   The proportion of water is given as 2/3, so we multiply the remaining apple drink by this fraction:\n   However considering that only a portion remains and not whole liquid , its better to simply keep the ratio\n   We will be multiplying (15/18)*(12) \n   which gives us = (5/6)*12=10 liters of water from apple.\n\n4. Calculate amount of water in 30 liters lemon drink:\n    The proportion is given as 4/5, so we multiply it with 30: \n     (4/5)*30=(4*30)/5=120/5 =24\n\n5. Now add the remaining liquid from step 2 and total lemon mixture to get the final volume of solution.\n   Final_volume_of_solution = Remaining_apple_drink + Total_lemon_mixture\n                             =15+30 \n                             =45.\n\n6.Add both waters calculated above since they are now together:\nFinal_water_amount_in_liquid=(10 liters)+(24)=34\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 34.",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n1. First, let's find out how much water is in the 13 liters of peach drink that are 4/5 water.\n   Since it has 4/5 water and a total volume of 13 liters, we can calculate its water content as follows: \n   (4 / 5) * 13 = 10.4\n\n2. Next, let's find out how much water is in the 21 liters of grape drink that are 1/3 water.\n   Since it has 1/3 water and a total volume of 21 liters, we can calculate its water content as follows: \n   (1 / 3) * 21 = 7\n\n3. After spilling 3 liters from the peach drink, you have:\n    - Water left in the remaining 10 liters of peach drink: 4/5 * 10 = 8\n    Total amount of water after pouring and before accounting for spillage is (the original water content) + (water in grape): \n   The total volume of liquid now being poured together would be the sum of the volumes, but subtracting the spilled liters from peach drink:  \n   - Peach drink remaining = 13 - 3 = 10\n    So, you have a total amount of:\n     8 (from peach) + 7 (from grape) = 15 \n\n4. Since we only want to know how much water is in the '31 liters' after pouring and accounting for spillage but before mixing together: \n   You still need to add back the original volume from the remaining part of each drink, then subtracting what would have been spilled:\n    - (Amounts that didn't get poured) 3/5 *10 +21 = total amount minus water in those parts. We also know this is equal to 31 liters \n   Therefore: we can ignore peach and simply look at grape plus the remaining part of each drink, then subtracting spillage from our original problem.\n   \nNow let's calculate how much liquid would be accounted for by non-water components:\n    - Non-peach = (1 /5) *10 + 21-7 \n   The amount in this case that is water: \n\nSo the final step to get a number, we have to find out what portion of total volume accounts for spillage. Spillage = spilled peach drink and non-water components:\n    - Non-water part from the peach (1 /5) * 10 +21-7 \n   Therefore our calculation for how much water in remaining is equal to: \n\nWe can calculate this as follows:\n\nWater content after spilling and pouring, which has a total volume of 31 liters. Since we know that spillage occurred only with peaches, then the answer should be simply (the amount from peach + grape) - non-water component.\n\nAmounts for each drink is accounted by knowing how much water in it as follows:\n- From peach = ((4/5)*10)=8 \n    The remaining part of 21 liters would have a portion that does not account towards the spillage since only peaches were spilled.\n   Non-peach = (1 /3) * 21 + (peach's non-water component)\n   Since total volume is accounted for by peach and grape drink we can just use it to calculate how much of those liquids are water.\n\nWater in remaining:\n= Amounts from both drinks - spillage \n    Now let us add the amount that has been poured. We already know this was 31 liters.\nWe subtracted only liquid lost (spillage) which is part of peach, but we also need to remove non-water parts in our calculation: \n\nNow let's calculate how much water would be left after accounting for spillage and adding back all the volumes from both drinks:\nWater content = amount poured - spilled peaches + non-spilled volume \n   Therefore:\n    Total liquid was 31 liters, with (spillages) accounted as follows:\n\nSpillage in terms of total is: \n\nLet's just get our final number now. The spillage has been accounted for by subtracting the part from peach drink that would be water and adding all other non-water components back into it.\nWater content:\n= Amounts poured - spilled peaches + (non-spilled volume)\n\nSo if we add 10 liters to both, then remove what was spilled: \nSince spillage only occurred in peaches. We need not consider the grape drink here at this point.\n\nLet's get our number now for water left after spilling and adding back non-water components:\n= Amounts poured - (spilled peach) + other liquid volumes \n\nNow let us add 10 liters to both, then remove what was spilled: \nThe final answer is $\\boxed{26.8}$",

First, let's find out how much water is in the original 11 liters of lemon drink that are four-fifths water.\n   Four-fifth (4/5) of 11 = 8.8 * 4 / 5 = 7\n2. So there are 7 liters of water in the initial amount of lemon drink.\n3. Now, let's find out how much water is in the original 16 liters of peach drink that has 1/8 water content:\n   One-eighth (1/8) of 16 = 16 * 1 / 8 = 2\n4. So there are 2 liters of water in the initial amount of peach drink.\n5. We spill 6 liters of lemon drink, so we have to consider how much water is left from that portion:\n   Water content spilled with lemon: (7/11) * 6 \n    Since it's four-fifths water then you calculate this as follows\n    = (4 / 5 ) * (6 /1 )\n    =24/5 \n   Now multiply numerator and denominator by 11 to get the fraction of liters that was spilled:\n     = (4*11) /(5)\n     =44/5 \n      So after subtracting water in 6 liters we have\n       =7 - {  (44 /5 )} * 1 \n        Since you are dividing it into a whole amount which is six so multiply by one. But since this has been divided and not multiplied then the fraction becomes:\n     =(44/5) * 6/11\n   To simplify, we'll have to divide both numerator and denominator in (44 / 5 ) * 1 by eleven:\n    = {44*6}/(55)\n      Now calculate \n      First multiply 44 with six: \n        =264/(55 )\n       Then now you can subtract the remaining water from lemon drink.\n   Water left in lemon drink after spilling some\n     So first find how much is spilled which was four fifths of 11 so to get it divided by eleven and then multiplied by four, since we already calculated that for six liters: \n      { (44*6)/55 }=24/11 *4 /5 =8.73 -7 +8.72\n   So water left from lemon is now eight point seven two.\n  Now add the remaining amount of peach drink to the amount spilled and remaining water in it:\n    The total quantity after spilling some of the mixture \n     After subtracting six liters then you have twenty one which was originally sixteen plus five so we can see that indeed only four liters were added, but this time for lemon.\n   16+5 =21\n6. Now to find out how much water is in the remaining amount (total of both drinks minus spilled portion), \n    So total quantity of peach drink after spilling some from the other drink \n     You had originally sixteen plus five which equals twenty one liters and this was lemon, so you can see that indeed only four were added for lemon but not to peach. However when calculating we consider whole amount.\n   Water in remaining portion (peach + water left in both drinks)\n    Total quantity = 21\n7. Now add the water content from peach drink which is two liters and subtracting spilled portion's fraction of water since it was four-fifths then you can multiply this by eleven to get its original amount that was divided into whole number six so as per previous calculation:\n   Water in remaining lemon \n     We already found out how much water remains after spilling: 8.72 liters\n    Total quantity = 21 \n Now we add the initial two from peach drink and subtract spilled portion's fraction of four fifths to get the final result.\n   Add this amount with original 2:\n    First, let's calculate that now by adding them together:\n     (7+6 ) +8.72 - {24/11}*4 /5 \n      =13+8.72- {(44*6)/55} \n       We already calculated the last part which equals to eight point seven two and we have it in above equation, so now just add 2 with that:\n    Total water content from peach drink plus remaining amount of lemon's portion\n   Add this quantity with original one (the initial amount):\n     Now subtract spilled fraction: \n      To get final result you will need to find the common denominator for both fractions and then calculate their sum.\n8.

Since he works 6-hour shifts each day and there are 6 days in a week, the total number of working hours per week is 6 * 6 = 36.\n2. Next, since Benjamin earns $11 per hour, his weekly earnings before bonus would be 36 * 11 = $396.\n3. We know that he gets an additional bonus of $404 each week if the company performs well.\n4. To find out how much money Benjamin made in a week when the company performed very well, we need to add both his hourly wages and the weekly bonus: 396 + 404 = $800 per week.\n5. February has 28 days (since it's not a leap year) or more specifically for this problem description - there are no indications that february was of any special month type so its safe to say febuary is like other months which have 4 full weeks and some extra hours in the last few days.\n6. Since Benjamin earns $800 per week, we can multiply it by the total number of weeks (assuming a standard February with no additional pay) he worked during that period: $800 * 4 = $3200.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is $3200",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. Ravi works a 12-hour shift each day, so in one week (5 days) he will work:\n   - 12 hours/day * 7 days/week = 84 hours/week\n2. Since Ravi earns €13 per hour and works for 84 hours a week, his weekly earnings are:\n   - 84 hours/week * €13/hour = €1092/week (without the bonus)\n3. The company also pays him an additional €351 as a bonus each week.\n4. Therefore, Ravi's total weekly income is: \n   - €1092/week + €351/week = €1443/week\n5. March has 31 days and assuming that there are no gaps in his schedule or any change to the number of hours he works per day, we can calculate how much money Ravi made in a month as follows:\n   - Since there's only one possible answer for this problem (we're not using 'n' variable), we know March has 4 full weeks and 3 extra days. However it is unnecessary to count those because the number of hours worked per day, or week will be constant.\n   Therefore: \n   Total income in a month = Number of weeks * Weekly earnings\n6. Since there are exactly four complete weeks (28 days), we can find Ravi's monthly total by multiplying his weekly pay by 4 and adding this result to the product of €351 per bonus for each week:\n    - So it is: \n   Total income in a month = Number of full weeks * Weekly earnings + Bonus amount\n7. Since there are no extra days, we don't have to do any more calculation than what's given above.\n8. Hence his weekly pay will be used as the multiplier for '4' (since he earns €351 per week) and added by this result 3 times.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is  $5,\\!772$",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \n\n1. First, we need to find the number of blue cards in relation to yellow cards since there are 25% more blue cards than yellow cards.\n   The formula for finding this is (number of yellow cards * percentage) /100 = increase\n   For our case, it will be 20*(25/100).\n   \n2. Calculating that we get the number of extra blue cards: \n   Extra Blue Cards = 5\n   \n3. To find out how many blue cards there are in total:\n   We add those to the base number (yellow card) and thus have our answer for the amount of blue cards which will be\n   Total Blue Cards = Base + Increase, where increase is the extra blue cards found before.\n   \n4. Calculating that we get: \n   20+5=25\n   \n5. Next step would involve finding out how many red card there are since they're equal to yellow and blue combined in number:\n   Red Card Amount will be (Yellow Cards + Blue Cards).\n   \n6. To find the answer, calculate this by taking both known numbers we've got so far.\n   This is calculated as: \n   20+25=45\n   \n7. Finally, combine all card colors to get an overall amount of cards:\n   Total Number Of Card = Yellow Cards + Red Cards + Blue Cards\n\n8. Now let's do the math for that last step using both known values we've found before.\n   We add up our total amounts so far and find out how many there are in total which is \n   20+45+25\n   \n9. Calculating this gives us:\n   Total cards = 90\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 90",

There are 54% more green cards than blue cards.\n   To find this increase in percentage as a decimal we divide it with hundred i.e., (54/100) = 0.54\n   Then multiply that with total no of Blue card which is 50 \n   Green Cards Increase: 50 * 0.54 = 27\n\n2. Adding the green cards' original number to its increase:\n   Total Green Card Number = Original Green Card No + (Increase in Green Cards)\n                        = 0 + (Blue Cards*0.54)  \n                        = 0+ 27\n                        = 27 \n\n3.

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \n\n1. First, we need to find out how many yellow cards there are in the set of magician's cards.\n   The number of orange cards is 75 and it says that there are 76% more yellow cards than orange ones,\n   so let us first calculate what does 'more' mean - 100% + 76%.\n\n2. To add percentages, we convert them into a common denominator which in this case can be made as 1.\n   So the total percentage is (100+76)/100 = 176/100 or simply 11/5.\n\n3. Now that means there are more yellow cards than orange ones by 11/5 times.\n   But to calculate how many yellow cards we have, let's find out what number will be when multiplied with 'orange' cards and then add the same factor of multiplication again which is (1+176/100) or simply ((5*100)+(4*76))/100 = 576/100.\n\n4. We can multiply it by 75 to get our answer, so yellow_cards = 75*(11/10).\n   The final step in finding out the number of 'yellow' cards is as follows: (75 * 11) / 5\n\n5. Now that we know how many orange and yellow cards there are,\n    let us find green ones which have to be equal to sum of both, so \ngreen_cards = ((orange + yellow)).\n\n6. First, calculate the number of 'yellow' cards: (75 * 11) / 5\n\n7. Now that we know how many yellow and orange cards there are,\n    let us find green ones which have to be equal to sum of both.\n   The total number of cards is then calculated as follows:\ntotal_cards = ((orange + yellow)).\n\n8. First, calculate the number of 'yellow' cards: (75 * 11) / 5\n9. Now that we know how many yellow and orange cards there are,\n    let us find green ones which have to be equal to sum of both.\n   The total number of cards is then calculated as follows:\ntotal_cards = ((orange + yellow)).\n\n10. We now need calculate the 'green' card count by adding up our earlier findings for orange and yellow, \nwhich we know are (75 * 11) / 5 = 165 and therefore green_card_count = 75+165\n\nThe final calculation to get total number of cards is as follows:\ntotal_cards = ((orange + yellow)) which simplifies into: total_cards = (((green)).\n\nNow that we have our values for orange, yellow, and 'green' card count,\nlet us put it together in an equation.\n \n11. First calculate the value of green_card_count by adding up both earlier findings\n   then get total number of cards (which is simply sum of all three):\ntotal_cards = ((orange + yellow)) which simplifies into: total_cards = (((green)).\n12. Then we have:\n    total_cards=75+165+(75+165)\n13. Total calculation can be simplified as follows\n   so the final answer for number of cards will simply become:\ntotal_cards=(3*165)+(2*75).\n\nStep by step simplification to get our result is as follows \n14.\n15. Let us simplify (3*165) + 150 = 495+150 which gives: total_cards=645.\n\n16. Now that we have found the value of green_card_count,\n   let's calculate how many cards there are in all mentioned colors\n    and finally find out what number is our answer.\ntotal_cards=(75+(11/5)*75)+(2*(165)).\n\n\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 645",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n1. Calculate the total weight of Ali and his 3 friends: \n   Since each friend weighs 75 kilograms, we multiply this number with 4 (the number of friends) to get their combined weight.\n   Total weight of friends = 75 * 4\n   Total weight of friends = 300\n\n2. Add Ali's van weight and the total weight of his friends:\n   The total load is a combination of the van, groceries, and people in it so we add those two numbers together: \n   Load (van + grocery) = Van_weight + Grocery_weight\n   Load (van + grocery) = 2650 + 375\n   Load (van + grocery) = 3025\n\n3. Now add Ali's weight to the load:\n   Since he is also in his van, we need to include him so it would be: \n   Total_weight = Load(van+grocery)+Ali Weight   \n   We don't know what Ali weighs but since that wasn't given, I am going to assume a normal average adult man's weight. The average healthy male has 78 kg (as of the knowledge cut-off date). Since we are solving this with an answer in one number and we can't include variables or unknowns, let us leave it as is.\n   Total_weight = Load(van+grocery) + Ali Weight\n   Total_weight = 3025 + 75 \n   \n4. Calculate total weight including groceries:\n   Now that I know the average man weighs about 78 kg but since we don't include variables in our solution, let us proceed to calculate it:  \n   Total_weight = Load(van+grocery) + Ali Weight\n   Total_weight = (3025) + 75 \n   \n5. Calculate total weight including groceries:\n    Now that I know the average man weighs about 78 kg but since we don't include variables in our solution, let us proceed to calculate it:  \n   Total_weight = Load(van+grocery)+Ali Weight\n   Since Ali was assumed as an adult with a typical male's height (which is approximately around) this value should be substituted here. \n    Let me make my final calculation using the 78 kg for him.\n   \n6.Calculate total weight including groceries:\n   Total_weight = Load(van+grocery)+Ali Weight\n   The average healthy man has about 78kg so that will do as a safe bet, I will proceed with this in order to finish my solution. \n    Since we can't include variables or unknowns let us leave it out for now and use the above calculation:\n    \n7.Calculate total weight including groceries:\n   Total_weight = (3025) + 78\n   Total_weight = 3103\n\n8.Now calculate force required: The problem states that the force to move is 4% of the load. To find this, multiply the Load by .04.\n   \nForce_required = (Total_weight)*0.04 \nSince we calculated total weight in step above as 3103 kg\nForce_required = (3103) * (.04)\n   Force_required = (3103)(40/1000)\n\n9.Final calculation of force required:\n    Multiply the numbers and simplify to get final answer.\n   \nAnswer: The final answer is $\\boxed{124.12}$",

Thus, total amount of food given to the goats would be number_of_goats * individual_feed_per_goat or (34*19)\n\n7. Finally add up both amounts calculated above: feed_to_donkeys + feed_to_goats.\n\n8. So now let's perform this final step for getting a solution:\n    - Total feed required = 39 *10+ 34 * 19 \n\nNow we do the math:\n\n- Feed to donkey is (39*10) which equals 390.\n- The total amount of food given to goats will be equal to  (34 * 19), this is therefore, (646).\n\n9. Adding up both amounts calculated above:\n   - Total feed required = (feed_to_donkeys + feed_given_goats)\n   - This now becomes: \n     - Feed_required=390+ 646\n\n10. To get our answer we just need to perform the last bit of math.\n    The total amount needed is therefore, equal to 1036.\n\nStep by step reasoning ends here and now for an answer:\nAnswer: The final answer is $\\boxed{1036}$.",

When Theo sees the Comet a second time, his age is two times the age of his father at that moment (i.e., x * 0 = 47).\n4. However it seems there's been an error in this interpretation - given what we're looking for here; let us rephrase:\n5. We know when Theo sees the comet a second time, he was TWO TIMES THE AGE OF HIS FATHER WHEN HE SAW IT (the first time) \n6. Therefore: 'x' = 47 + some years have passed since then\n7. Now we are told that this second viewing occurs two times his father's age when Theo himself was x; thus:\n   - Two times the age of Theo at comet sighting one, is equal to (2 * x).\n8.

Substituting from above:\n    - x+90-x=2*x\n14. The result is this simplification here, where both sides are equal to zero and cancel out the variable in between them; leaving us with a single solution for 'x'.\n15. Since we see that 47 + y = (90 years of orbit divided into two instances) - x then it's just subtracting an equivalent amount on each side from our previous expression \n    The result is this simplification where both sides are equal to zero, cancel out the variable in between them; leaving us with a single solution for 'x'.\n16. This leaves y=90-x as 0 and cancels x = (47+y) since we're trying to solve what value of x satisfies our given problem description\n17.

According to the problem, Yusuf's grandfather was 43 years old when he saw the Comet.\n3. Since we are given that Yusuf sees the comet a second time at an age two times his grandfather's age (which is 86), this means it has taken another cycle of comet appearance for him to reach double his grandfathers original viewing age, and therefore seen the comet once more; since each Comet Encke orbit takes about sixty years. This implies that Yusuf was x + (2 * number_of_orbits) when he saw the Comet a second time.\n4. We can determine the total years passed for two orbits of comet encke to be 120 years as this is how long it took for yusuf's age at viewing the comet once more, in relation to his grandfather originally seeing the comet (60 *2 =120).\n5. Yusuf sees the Comet a second time when he was twice the age his grandfather saw the Comet which we now know equates to 86 years of age.\n6. Therefore since this event happened after 120 years from yusufs first viewing, and is two times older than yusufs grandfathers original age at comet sighting (43), then Yusuf must have been aged x + 60 when he was twice the age his grandfather saw it for originally; with a total of 86 being this double-age. \n7. Now we need to find out what was the value of x, that makes this relationship valid.\n8. The following equation is formed: x + (2* number_of_orbits) = two_times_original_age_at_comet_sighting\n9. With Yusuf's second viewing age being 86 and having occurred after one full orbit plus another; we get:\n10. We can rewrite the above information in terms of an equation to calculate X with this formula: x + (2* number_of_orbits) = two_times_original_age_at_comet_sighting.\n11. Substituting known values into our equation, where 86 represents Yusufs age at seeing comet second time; and we know that a full orbit takes sixty years gives:\n12. We now have the following: x + (2*60)=86\n13. This simplifies to x+120=86 \n14. Subtracting 120 from both sides of this equation, we get our answer.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is -34",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \n\n1. Let's denote Viktor's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'V'. \n2. According to the problem, his grandfather was 32 years old when he saw the Comet.\n3. The second time Viktor saw the Comet, he was three times the age of his grandfather at that point in time (which is still 32), so Viktor's age during this event can be written as: V = 3 * 32\n4. Since we know from step 2 and the information about the years it takes for comet Encke to orbit, there must have been a period of time between these two events that corresponds with how long it takes Comet Encke to make one full orbit around Sun.\n5. Given that Viktor's grandfather was 32 when he saw the Comet (which is roughly in year x) and knowing his age at the second sighting can be used as: V = 3 * 32, we have a starting point for figuring out how much time has passed between these two sightings - which must correspond with comet Encke orbiting period.\n6. Viktor was three times older when he saw it again than what his grandfather's age would've been at that specific event (still the same number of years later as before, but now this is 3 * 32). This makes us able to set up a relationship between time passed and orbital periods: \n   - Comet Encke orbits in approximately every 75 years. We can represent this with an equation x + y = 75 where:\n     x represents the amount of years that have elapsed from when Viktor's grandfather first saw comet Encke (at age 32), to when he was old enough for his son (Viktor) to see it again, \n    and\n      y would be how many more years after seeing Comet in second sighting passed until comets orbital period elapses.\n7. We have been given that Viktor's grandfather saw the comet at some age x where 3 times this amount of time later is when Viktor sees the comet a second time (as shown by V = 32 * 3). So, we can say: \n   - Time from first to last sighting in relation with comets orbital period would be approximately:\n     y + (y + years between sightings) ≈ 75\n\n8. We know that 'years between sights' equals the number of times Comet Encke has orbited since Viktor's grandfather saw it which is simply: \n   - The difference from his age when he first saw comet to how old he was at second sighting in relation with comets orbital period / Comets orbiting time = y + (y + years between sightings). And this can be calculated by the following equation:\n     3 * 32 / 75.\n9. Now we have been able to determine 'years since first comet sighting'. Since Viktor's age at second event was three times as much, he must've also aged in that same time period.\n\n10. With all information known and calculations made from steps above: \n    We know how long the years between two comets sightings were (3 * 32 / 75). And given this is equal to both Viktor's aging over those 'years since first comet sighting' as well as his grandfather, we can determine that:\n     - Years in which Coment Encke orbited for second event was observed = y + years between two events ≈ ((y + (3 * 32 / 75))).\n11. Given that all the calculations made have been accounted from information given about time elapsed and using orbital period of Comet Encke to solve Viktor's age when he saw comet first, we can set up an equation with calculated value for 'years since first event' equaling difference between ages at second sighting:\n     3 * (32 + ((75 - years in which Coment orbited) / 2)) = V.\n12. Plug the expression from step 10 into this new equation: \n    We know how long it takes Comet Encke to orbit is approximately every 75 years, therefore we can simplify 'years since first comet sighting' using previously calculated value (3 * 32)/75 ≈ 14/25 of an orbital cycle:\n     - Simplifying that gives us ((75-((3*32)/(75)))).\n\n13. We plug the result from step 10 into new equation and get: \n    V = 96 + (((2*(14))/(5))).\n\n14. This can be simplified further to solve for 'Viktor's age at first comet sighting':\n     - Simplify previous expression using order of operations (PEMDAS):\n\n15. Solve this by simplifying the above equation:\n   - First do exponentiation \n   96 + ((2*14)/5)\n   then multiplication: \n      (28/5) \n    and add it to number without fraction that results in final answer for age at first sighting.\n\n16. So, we can plug those values into expression V",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. Mateo's dad saw the Comet when he was 43 years old.\n2. Let's denote Mateo's age at that time as x, so we can set up an equation: \n   However since it is about his dads age and not Mateos then this information alone isn't helpful in finding out how old mateo will be\n3. Then Mateo saw the comet a second time when he was two times the age his dad was when he saw the Comet.\n4. This means that at the point of seeing the comet for the 2nd time, Mateos dads age would have been: \n   (Mateos Age / 2)\n5. The difference in years between these events is a multiple of 80 as this will be one complete orbit\n6. Since we know it took his dad x to see the Comet once and its another two times that value at the second observation then Mateo's age when seeing for the first time can be described by:\n   Let (Mateos Age /2) +x =a multiple of 80 \n7. This a is equal to an integer, as it has to represent years which are whole units\n8. Since we also know that his dad was x at the comet's observation then Mateo will have been: \n    Two times this age when he observed for the second time and so Mateos first age would be 2x - (Mateos Age/2) \n   Which can now be rewritten as:\n     (3(Mateos Age / 2)) - x = multiple of eighty.\n9. But since we know that Comet Halley orbits every eightty years then a must also equal an integer\n10. Mateo's dad was 43, so the number of times he saw it is: \n    So when did his son see it for second time?\n11. The first comet sighting occurred eighty years before this observation and hence we know that x +80 = Multiple of 80\n12. Now to find out how old Mateo would be at the point in which his dad was forty three lets call (Mateos First Age) A then:\n    Since he will see it two times as much older than when his dad saw him for first time we can use this formula: \n    a = 2 * ((80+x)/3 + x)\n13. This simplifies down to: \n   Let's find the lowest number that is divisible by both (A/2) and eighty then add forty three\n14. Now let A be in terms of our known variable, so we can use it as follows:\n    160 = Multiple of eighty plus (3 * Mateos Age)\n15. And since 80 + x must also equal a multiple of eighty to keep with this comet's pattern.\n16. This leads us down the road that A/2 and eighty are both factors in an expression like so: \n   A/2 + 43 = Multiple Of Eighty\n17. To find out what (A / 2) is, we can do a little algebra to work it back up from forty three:\n    ((3(A/2)) - x)/80 = integer and hence when divided by eighty it gives an even number \n18. Then since the expression: 43 + A/2 will also be divisible by eight then both sides of this equation must be divisible by a multiple of twenty\n19. And to get back our original variable we can use these facts:\n    (160 - x)/3 = Multiple Of Eighty and hence eighty plus forty three is equal to Mateo's age at the time he sees it for second.\n20. The answer now becomes apparent: 80 * ((Multiple of Twenty) + Forty Three /Eighty)\n21. Simplify that down\n22. And so we can rewrite this in terms of a multiple of twenty by dividing forty three by eighty:\n    (160 - x)/3 = Multiple Of Eighty and hence Mateos age at the time he sees it for second will be \n   80 * ((Multiple of Twenty) + Forty Three /Eighty)\n23. Simplify that down\n24. And since this must also equal an integer we can now divide forty three by eighty to get:\n    (160 - x)/3 = Multiple Of Eighty and hence Mateos age at the time he sees it for second will be \n   80 * ((Multiple of Twenty) + Forty Three /Eighty)\n25. So we have that A/2 is equal to a multiple of forty then mateo would have been:  \n    (160 - x)/3 = Multiple Of Eighty\n26. And hence he must also see it for first time when his dads age will be eighty plus an integer times twenty and so in terms of the variable we can now rewrite this as:\n   Mateos Age at second comet sighting is equal to forty three + 80 * ((Multiple of Twenty) + Forty Three /Eighty)\n27.",

First, let's find the total weight of all 5 salmons caught.\n   - The first salmon weighs 78 pounds and the second one weighs 50 pounds\n   However there are three more left to be added which weigh less then these two.\n\n2. We know that Noah also caught a third (25 pounds), fourth, fifth(we don't have any information for them but we can still find their weight using averages). \n3. Since the problem doesn’t specify anything about other fish weights, it is reasonable to assume all 5 weighed approximately equal or average in size.\n\n4. Let's take an example of finding an approximate value by calculating a total of what he caught:\n   The first salmon =78 pounds\n   The second one =50 pounds \n   And the last (we know) third fish=25pounds.\n   \n   Now we can calculate remaining 2 weight with average: let x be that weight for each then 4x is sum and this should equal to total of weights -3fish known. This gives us:\n   Total Weight = The first salmon +The second one+third fish +(last two fishes)\n                 =78 pounds+(50 pounds)+25pounds+2*x \n5. Now let's solve for x (average) since the fourth and fifth are unknown.\n   4x= total of weights -3fish known\n    so,\n   The first salmon +The second one+third fish +(last two fishes)= 153+pounds \n6. Given that there is no information about other four we will just use all data to make a guess using averages.\n\n7. Let's proceed with our calculation and find out the weight of remaining salmons\n    Now let’s calculate it,\n   total Weight = (78 +50+25) pounds +(average)\n     so, \n     153+pounds+(2 * x )=total.\n8. Since there is no information about other four we will just use all data to make a guess using averages.\n9. To find the value of 'x', let's assume that Noah caught some average fish with weight equal or around these three weights.\n\n10. Now, \n    153 pounds +(2*x) = total\n   We have no information about last two so lets take an example by calculating approximate values and then check for our final answer.\n11. For the sake of calculation let's say all five weigh approximately same to get average weight or equal them with given fish weights (average value).\n12. Since we do not know what other 2 salmons are like in this problem, it is more logical that they must be near these three values and therefore their total will probably be close to:\n   let us check using all our data.\n13. Now,\n    The first salmon +The second one+third fish +(last two fishes)\n     =153 pounds+(average)=  the weight of last four salmons \n14. Using given weights we can now find out what is average for those two unknowns and then multiply with 2 to get our answer.\n15. Now let’s solve it using an approximation where all five weigh approximately same (Average).\n   To do that, first calculate total weight -3fish known =153 pounds+(average) \n    This gives us,\n   The first salmon +The second one+third fish +(last two fishes)\n     153+pounds\n16. Since there is no information about other four we will just use all data to make a guess using averages.\n17. For the sake of calculation let's say all five weigh approximately same (average) and then check for our final answer.\n\nNow, since total weight = The first salmon +The second one+third fish +(last two fishes)\n    Total Weight=153+pounds\n   Since we know that \n     5 salmons caught but no information about the last four.\n18. So let's try an approximation using average weights:\n   \n   Using given data: (78 pounds,50pounds ,25 pounds) as all fish of equal or near these weight in this case to get approximate value.\n\n19 Now since total =153+pounds\n20  And now we will find out what is the last two salmons and then multiply by their average. \n   Total Weight= The first salmon +The second one+third fish +(last two fishes)\n               So let's say they weigh approximately same to get an approximate value.\n21 Now since total =153+pounds\n22  Using given data: (78 pounds,50pounds ,25 pounds) as all fish of equal or near these weight in this case. \n   we know that last four are either the first second third or fourth which will be average and multiply by two to get our answer.\n23 Now since total =153+pounds\n24  The only way for us is calculate remaining using averages now: let x be that weight for each then 4x is sum of unknowns \n   so,\n    (78 pounds)+(50pounds",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n1. Liam has to take 7 classes in total (6 normal periods + 1 extra class).\n2. Each class is 60 minutes long, so the total number of minutes spent on these classes per week can be calculated as follows: \n   - Normal classes for 6 days a week = 5 * 60 * 6\n   - Extra class once a day (for example Monday) since Liam has to take one extra period but this is not specified which specific day it occurs. Hence we consider that the extra time could be on any of these six weekdays, and in order for him to have an equal number of minutes each week he should still spend 60 *7 total.\n   - Extra class per week = 1 * 60\n3. Now let's calculate the normal classes: \n   Normal classes per week = 5 * 60 *6 = 1800\n4. Total extra learning time for Liam is the minutes in one of his regular weekdays (since we can't assume which day) + Extra class.\n   - So total weekly class time = 1800+60=1860 \n5. Since he spends 1/7 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday, let's find out how many weeks are there in a year so that the extra learning time could be calculated for all seven days: \n   There are approximately 52 weeks per year.\n6. Now to determine Liam’s total weekly class time plus weekend study we need first calculate his total daily or yearly minutes which is equal to 60 *7 =4200 minutes per day\n    Since there are 365 days in a non leap year and it has been mentioned he goes for six of those seven weekdays, then \n   - His regular weekly learning (6 classes) would be: 1800.\n   Now let's calculate his weekend study time:\n      - Liam’s total yearly minutes spent on class is equal to the number of days in a non leap year *4200 =365*4200\n7. So his extra minute for each week which he spends during weekends (saturdays and sundays) would be as follows: \n    The number of weeks per year=52, so we can now calculate Liam’s total weekly class time plus weekend study by using this formula:\n   - His regular yearly learning minutes = 365 *7*60\n   Now let's subtract that from the whole yearly minute and divide it to get extra studying each week: \n     The number of weeks in a year=52. Thus, his weekend study would be (365-6) /52 *4200.\n8. Weekend Study time per week =  ((365 - 6)/52 ) *4200 minutes\n   Let's now calculate the regular learning for six days and add that to extra minute for each of these two weekends:\n    Total weekly class time plus weekend study is: \n      (1800 + (((365-6) /52)*4200))\n\nStep by step reasoning ends here. \n\nNow let’s solve this problem.\nFirst, we need the value for  ((365 - 6)/52)\n=359/52\nWe know that dividing numbers of whole days in a non leap year minus number of weekdays and then divide it with weeks = extra study time \n((365-6) /52)*4200= (359/52)*4200\n\nNow let's do the math:\n(359* 4200)/52 ≈35070.769\nSo, weekend Study time per week is approximately equal to: 35071 minutes.\n\nSince there are two of these weekends then that would be \n2 * 35071 =70142 \n\nHence total weekly class time plus weekend study for Liam equals (1800 + 70142)\n\nNow let's calculate the final answer:\n=70592\nThe number of hours in a week spent on learning by Liam is calculated as follows: \nTotal minutes per week /60\n\nAnswer: The final answer is $\\boxed{1176.867}$.",

Faisal takes 2 extra classes, each class is 30 minutes long, so the total time spent in these two classes per day is: \n   2 * (60/100) * 30 = 36 minutes\n2. Since he goes to school for all six periods as well, let's first calculate his daily learning hours:\n    Each period lasts about an hour.\n    Total daily class time without extra classes: 6 * 1 = 6 hours\n3. Now adding the two extra classes which take up a total of 36 minutes or (36/60) hours per day:\n   Daily learning hours for school periods including Faisal's extra classes are equal to \n   6 + (36/60)\n4. Since he spends time on class four days in a week, we'll multiply the daily amount by four.\n    Four-day weekly school period and extra learning hours = [6+(36/60)] * 4\n5. To determine how much of his weekend Faisal uses for additional studying:\n   He divides one eighth (1/8) of his total weekly minutes between Saturday and Sunday as study time \n6. First, let's calculate the full week with classes which he does in four days:   \n    A seven-day period is 7 *24 = 168 hours long.\n    Since Faisal goes to class for 4 out of those 7 days (i.e., on school days), his daily learning time gets multiplied by \n   [1 - (3/7)] which means he does not go in three non-school days a week. But here we want total weekly minutes, so let's find the\n   amount spent during four class days first:\n    Four-day weekly school period and extra learning hours = [6+(36/60)] * 4 \n     After calculating this value:  \n      (6 +0.6) * 4 = 27.\n7. Now to calculate full week including Saturday & Sunday, he studies a total of\n   His daily time spent in class for four school days is equal to \n    Four-day weekly school period and extra learning hours calculated earlier which was 27. To get the whole seven day week:   \n     (168) * [(1/8)]\n8. Subtract this weekend study amount from full-week minutes without considering his one-eighth time used on weekends.\n   Total study hours for four days a week are:\n    Four-day weekly school period and extra learning hours calculated earlier which was 27\n9. Next, convert the total number of minutes Faisal learns each day during class to an hourly value by multiplying it with (1/60).\n     We had: \n      [6+(36/60)] * 4 = 28.\n10. Now calculate how many extra hours he spends on studying per week:\n    Since we already have the total four-day weekly time as well, now add that to his weekend study minutes after converting it into hourly format for both days and then divide by two (to get average) \n     because they're equal\n   7 *24 =168 hours. He has one eighth or a portion of this used on Saturday & Sunday:\n      As we know he already spends time during four class days which is:  \n         Four-day weekly school period and extra learning hours calculated earlier which was 27.\n    Total minutes in the seven day week equal to \n     (1/8) * 168\n11. Converting this into an hourly format by multiplying with (1/60):\n   So now, his total study time for both Saturday & Sunday is:    \n      [(7*24)*(1/8)] / 60.\n12. Now we can subtract the amount of extra class hours from weekend and then divide it equally between these two days \n    because this additional one eighth portion was split in half when Faisal learns on Saturdays and Sundays\n   Since he studies a total for four school days equal to:\n      Four-day weekly school period and extra learning hours calculated earlier which was 27.\n13. Finally, convert the daily amount into an hourly format by multiplying it with (1/60).\n14. Add these weekend study minutes in hour after converting them from minute format\n15. After that subtract this value of Faisal's four day time spent on school periods and extra classes in hours to find how many more he spends learning each week \n   To get his weekly amount for Saturdays & Sundays add those two values together since it is the same then divide by 2:\n      [(7*24)*(1/8)] / 60.\n16.

Now let's calculate the result from step 1.\n   We have 9 * 50, so:\n   Total weekly time spent learning in school (in minutes) = 450\n\n3. Next we need find out how many extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday combined for his learning.\n   He spends 2/4 of his total minutes per week as an extra class period each day that isn't a weekday, so:\n    - Total weekly time spent in school (in minutes) = 450\n    - Extra learning minutes per non-weekday = 1 * (3 / 7) * 450 \n   After calculating this we find out: \n   \t- Additional minutes on Saturday and Sunday for extra class period each day is equal to:\n      So it's equal to 2/4 or half of the total weekly time spent learning in school.

Finally let's calculate how many hours in all Kai spends on learning each week.\n    To do so we need to divide both numbers (Total minutes per week and weekend) by 60 since there are sixty minutes in an hour.\n\n5. Calculating these two values:\n   - Total weekly time spent learning in school (in hours) = total_minutes_per_week / 60\n   - Extra class period minutes on Saturday and Sunday combined per week is: extra_minutes_per_weekend/60 \n     First let's calculate the value of first expression.\n   \t- Result for total_minutes_per_week divided by sixty is equal to:\n       So it equals (450)/60 =7.5\n\n6.

Add regular school hours to get total class time per day:\n    However there are no details about how many 'regular' period is in his schedule, so we assume he doesn't have extra classes on these days as well.\n   So each weekday Arash spends 160 minutes (extra) + some unknown number of periods = x. Let's move forward with what we know.\n\n3. Calculate total class time per week: \n    Since there are 4 weekdays in a school week, and he goes to school for those 4 days, the weekly extra classes would be:\n   Extra classes * minutes/class/weekday\n   That is (160) * 4 = 640 minutes\n\n4. Find out how much time Arash spends on learning per Saturday: \n    He spends 1/6 of his total class time in a week for these days.\n   \n5. Calculate the number of minutes he spends on extra classes each Sunday:\n   Same as above.\n\n6. Add up all hours spent by calculating weekly school time plus weekend study times and convert to hours:\n\n   First, calculate what fraction of 1/7 is (4+2) i.e., how much time Arash actually dedicates in a week\n    His total class minutes per day are x which we do not know.\n     Let's represent the number of regular periods as 'y'. The equation then would be: y * some value + 160 = x\n\n   We already calculated that his extra classes add up to 640, and there is an unknown period. So let’s say he attends a total of (some_value) minutes worth of school per day which includes both regular class periods plus the given 40 minute long 'extra' ones.\n\n   To find out some value we need more data but since it's mentioned that for our purposes this information isn't necessary, so what can be safely done is to just add his extra classes in minutes each week (640), and multiply by how much of a day he dedicates on the weekend which would indeed be 1/6th.\n\n   First let’s convert all hours into total weekly class time.\n   \n7. Calculate Saturday and Sunday study times:\n    Weekly school time + Weekend learning = Total number of minutes Arash learns per week\n     Let's say, extra classes * some_value (representing unknown period) for weekdays is 'y'. \n     This will add up to y+160 in a day.\n    \n   Since the total weekly class minutes would be x*y then that value we just found out can multiply by 4. Then he spends an additional two days on weekend, which are indeed equal to (1/6) * ((x*y)*7). \n   \n    This is because his extra classes + some_value = y so this 'some_value' gets represented as a variable in the equation.\n    \n   Now we need to calculate total weekly school time. As given Arash goes to class for 4 days, and he has an unknown regular period each day which can be denoted by x \n    In that case, his extra classes are indeed (160) minutes per day.\n\n8. Calculate weekend learning hours:\n    He spends 1/6 of this on Saturday.\n    \n9. Add up school time in a week plus weekend study to get the total weekly class time: \n\nNow we can finally calculate the number of minutes Arash dedicates each year or each month but what is needed here, however, is his daily hours not yearly so it would be best if that could be derived.\n    \nTo find out how many hours he learns per week, first let’s convert all these values into a more understandable format i.e., in terms of time. \n\nStep 1: \nLet's start with the number of minutes Arash spends on class each day:\n    There are (4+2) weekdays and weekends where his total school time is indeed divided by 'some_value'. This makes it equal to y + x = z.\n    \n   Then we can multiply this value by how many days he goes to class in a week which would be 7. \n\nStep 3: \n    So now, Arash's weekly extra classes are calculated as (160) * 4 = 640 minutes.\n\nNow the total number of hours spent on learning is simply ((x*y)*4 + (1/6)*(y*x*7)) /60\n\nTo get this in terms of 'some_value' we just need to find out how many periods he has per week.\n    \nStep 2:\n   Since each day his extra classes add up to an unknown number of regular school hours plus the given",

Now we need to find out how much extra time he will spend studying on the weekend days, i.e., Saturday and Sunday:\n    Jamal spends five-sixths (or 5/6) of his total weekly learning minutes as extra study hours for these two days.\n\n   Total number of weekdays = 6\n   So there are a week's worth of weekday classes in one week. \n   \n- Let the time he spent studying on both Saturday and Sunday be denoted by x.\n - We already calculated Jamal spends 31.5 * 60 minutes per week on his classwork (which is equal to total number of weekdays, so it can also represent a weeks worth).\n   His extra learning hours for saturday + sunday = Total weekly study time minus weekday studytime\n- Weekly study time in minutes: \n    - Since there are 7 days and he spends the remaining day studying on Saturday. And another one is Sunday.\n     Let total week-day minutes be y, then x = (5/6) * [2*y +y].\n      We already know that his weekday classes last for a weeks worth of time which can also be used as 'Total weekly studytime - weekend study hours'\n       Since 7 days are available in one week. \n        Then total number of classwork minutes he will spend each day = Total amount of weekdays * duration per class.\n      We have already calculated his weekday classes' duration to last for a weeks worth, i.e., Jamal spends 31.5*60 = 1890 minutes on school work during the entire week.\n- Time spent in extra learning hours for saturday + sunday = (5/6) * [2*y+y] \n   - We know that y is equal to total weekly studytime minus weekendstudy time\n    - Thus, x = (5/6)*(3y).\n     But we also have the equation: \n        Total amount of classwork he will spend in a week + Weekend Study hours  = Weekly studytime.\n      So now this can be written as y+((5/6)(2*y+y))=weekly study time\n   - After plugging our values into equations:\n    weekly studytime minutes is equal to his total weekday classes' duration, i.e., Total amount of weekdays * classwork per day which we know equals 1890.\n- Now let's plug in the value for y from equation (1) \n     x = (5/6)*(3*y)\n      - So weekendstudy hours are\n       ((5/6)(2*1890 + 1890))\n        /60, i.e., when converted to hour.\n\n   Thus:\n- Weekend study time: (((5 * 7560)/360)/(1)) \n= 10500 minutes or in other words,\nWeekend extra learning hours = (10.5) hrs \n\n- Total weekly classwork + weekendstudytime\n   - Now that we know he spends a total of (31+10.5) h per week on his studies, our final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 41.",

First, let's calculate the total number of minutes Thiago spends in classes each day:\n   - He takes 3 extra classes and a normal student has 8 periods, so he goes to class for (3 + 8) = 11 periods.\n   - Each period is 40 minutes long, so the total time spent on these days per week is: \n     (6 * 55) = 330 minutes.\n\n2. Next, let's calculate the number of minutes Thiago spends in classes each day for Saturday and Sunday:\n   - Since he attends school only from Monday to Friday, we need to find out how many periods there are on a normal weekday.\n   - A normal student has 8 periods per day but since this problem is referring to 'a normal student' rather than the total number of minutes that would be spent in class by such an average pupil. This can be interpreted as simply stating Thiago's classes amounting to, \"normal\" for him, which still consists of 11 (as calculated before) periods.\n   - So he attends school for a total time of 55 * 6 = 330 minutes on these days.\n\n3. We need to find the extra learning time spent by Thiago on Saturday and Sunday:\n   - He spends three-sixths of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time, but this calculation is not needed here since we can simply add up all his daily periods.\n   \n4. To calculate total weekly hours for school + study: \n    (330 * 2) = 660 minutes from the weekend classes\n     Total class-time in a week is then equal to:\n       - (6 days of regular attendance, that equals 330 each day)\n        Plus the time spent on Saturday and Sunday.\n   The total weekly learning minutes Thiago spends are: \n    (6 * 330) + (660) = 2640 minutes.\n\n5. To convert this number into hours we simply divide by 60:\n   - Total class-time in a week is then equal to: (2640 / 60)\n     This will give us the weekly time spent learning as an integer value.\n   \nAnswer: The final answer is $\\boxed{44}$",

To find the total daily learning time, add extra class times and normal class times:\n   Total weekly time from all classes =\n (Total regular class time) + (Extra class time)\n = 420 + 840 \n = 1260 minutes.\n\n5. Faisal then spends four-sixths of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.\n   First, let's find out how much he studies in a week: Since there are 24 hours * 7 days = 168 hours per week,\n    this equals to (60*60) or 10.8 * 1000 which is equal to 108000 minutes.\n\n6.

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \n1. Let's first calculate the total amount of money Mateo spent on popcorn and cookies.\n   We know he bought 9 bags of popcorn for ₺0.75 each, so the cost is:\n   Cost of popcorn = Number of bags * Price per bag\n                    = 9 * 0.75 \n                    = $6.75\n\n2. Since we don't know how many cookies Mateo purchased yet and he had 6% of his money left in change, let's represent the amount spent on cookies as 'x'.\n   Then total cost is:\n   Total Cost = Cost of popcorn + x (Cost of cookies)\n              = $6.75 + x\n\n3. We also know that after spending this much money, Mateo had 6% of his initial ₺1200 left in change.\n   The amount he spent on all items can be represented as:\n   Amount Spent = Total Initial Money - Remaining Change\n                = (Total Initial Money * Percentage Left) / 100\n                = ($1200 * 94)/100 \n                = $1128\n\n4. Since we calculated the total cost in step 2, and now know that it is equal to the amount spent on all items from step 3, let's equate these two equations.\n   We get:\n   Total Cost = Amount Spent\n             => ($6.75 + x) = $1128\n\n5. To find out how much Mateo paid for cookies 'x', we subtract cost of popcorn from the amount spent on all items and then solve this equation to determine value of 'x'.\n   (Cost of Cookies)\n  So,\n    Cost of Cookies = Amount Spent - Cost of Popcorn \n                    => x\n                     = $1128 -$6.75\n                     = $1119.25\n\n6. Mateo purchased cookies for ₺125 each, so the number of cookies he bought is:\n   Number of cookies = Total cost / Price per cookie\n                   = ($1119.25) ÷ 1.25 \n                   = 895",

      "options": [],
      "answer": 1162.0
    },
    "logic_problem": {
      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n1. Let's first find out how much money Diego had initially before he made any purchases.\nSince 3% of his $900 remaining is change, we can say that the rest (97%) was spent on cookies and popcorn.\n\nLet x be the initial amount in dollars. We know that after spending some money, he has 0.03x left as a percentage which equals to $900.\n\nWe have:\n(1 - 0.03)x = 900\n\nSolving for x,\n(0.97) * x = 900\nx = (900 / 0.97)\nx ≈ 928.688\n\nSo Diego had approximately $928.69 initially.\n2. Now let's find the total cost of cookies:\nDiego bought 3 bags of cookies at a price of 50 cents per bag which is equivalent to $0.5.\n\nTotal cost for cookies = Number of cookie bags * Price of one bag\n= (3) * ($0.5)\n≈ $1.49\n\n3. The remaining money after buying the cookies would be:\nInitial amount - Cost for cookies ≈ 928.69 - 1.49 \n≈ $927.20 \n\n4. Diego spent this amount on both popcorn and change.\n\nWe know that he had 0.03x = 900 dollars as a percentage of his initial budget which is equal to the remaining money after buying all snacks.\nHowever, we found out in step three that it's actually less than what was initially stated. This means the question statement has an error or there must be some leftover change from popcorn purchase not accounted for here.\n\nWe'll assume this discrepancy doesn't affect our overall understanding of how much he spent on popcorn.\n\n5. Diego also got 3% as a percentage remaining which equals to $900 in dollars, but that can only happen if the amount left over is equivalent to his total spend minus initial budget times (100-97)% or simply said leftover cash after all snacks purchases - we already calculated it above and found out he indeed spent this much on popcorn.\n\n6. Now let's find how many bags of popcorn Diego bought:\nDiego had $927.20 for the remaining items, which were 3% change that equals to $900 + cost of one bag (75 cents) times number of purchase plus leftover cash not considered yet.\nWe already determined his money after purchasing cookies above.\n\nThe total amount he spent on snacks is equal to initial budget minus this $1.49\nThat will leave him with a little extra in case the price for popcorn was less than initially assumed - let's say y cents per bag and we'll assume leftover cash not considered here doesn't change his actual spend on popcorn.\nSo cost of popcorn equals amount he spent after cookies purchase.\n\nCost = Price * Number of items\nWe know that:\nPrice of one item is 75 cents which is equivalent to $0.75\n\nLet the number of bags be n, then total money spent for snacks will equal initial budget minus leftover cash in case there was some change from popcorn not considered above.\nTotal spend on snacks = Initial amount - Cost of cookies \n\nSince he had this remaining after all purchases,\nInitial Amount *  (1-0.03) -Cost For Cookies = Total Spend On Snacks.\n\nNow we have:\n928.688* (97/100)-($0.5)= $900 + ($0.75)n\n\nSimplifying the equation for n, \n(897.23)*((100)/97)-(0.05)=(900)+(0.75)(n)\n\nWe need to isolate 0.75*(n), which is cost of popcorn.\nCost of Popcorn = Initial money after cookies purchase - $900\n= (897.23 * ((100/97)))-$1 \n≈ ($899.88) \n\nThe equation for n can be written as follows:\n(898.83)-(4.5)=(0.75)(n)\nDivide both sides by 0.75,\n(n)=((898.33)/(3))\nWe need to convert our number into whole items and ensure it is in dollars, since that's the required unit of currency for this problem.\nIt means we have:\n(n) ≈ (299.44/1)\n\nSince you can't buy a fraction of an item let us multiply by 4 \n(299 * ((100)/25))\n\nSo\nn = number of bags bought\n\nWe found out n in previous step to be approximately equal to 12.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is $\\boxed{11}$.",

    "logic_problem": {
      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. Qasim spent ₣500 and had 8% of his money left in change, so he must have gotten a total of ₣1000 (because 92% is remaining from the original amount).\n2. He bought popcorn for 35 cents each. We need to convert this to the currency used; however, we will be using the same unit throughout.\n3. If Qasim spent ₣500 and he got back his change in a different denomination of money (₧) then it would mean that all other transactions are made with that specific type of money (in this case pretzels), but since popcorn is priced at 35 cents we can safely assume the price for popcorn has been converted into an equivalent value, however I'll leave out conversion from one currency to another as ₧ isn't widely used anymore. \n4. The problem doesn’t specify which unit of money was being spent or given back; so let's say that he got his change in a different denomination and we have 1000 units total (₧).\n5. Let P be the number of bags Qasim bought popcorn for, then P = 5.\n6. If each bag is ₣35, then the amount spent on popcorn would be 5 * ₣35.\n7. We know he got his change in a different denomination and we have to find out how many pretzels were sold; however we can safely assume that since there are only two types of products being bought from this machine (popcorn for 0.35$ or whatever currency is used) then the rest would be spent on pretzels.\n8. Let's call Qasim’s money before he purchased anything as X, and his change after purchasing everything A; thus we have: \n    a = x - b\n9. We know that:\n   i. 92% of ₣500 is equal to the remaining amount left in the machine so it can be represented by this formula (0.92) * 1000 = X, where X represents his total money and A would represent change.\n10. Since we already calculated a total value for Qasim’s initial funds as 920 units; let's call B to be an amount of pretzels bought in ₧ then \n    b + (5 * ₣35) is equal to the original ₧1000 because this represents his money spent on both popcorn and pretzel.\n11. The remaining percentage that was left after Qasim purchased 5 bags of popcorn can be computed using an equation:\n   i. a = x - b\n12. Since we have two unknowns in our equations above, let's re-write the second one to see if it will help us solve for B (the number of pretzels he bought). \n    ii. 0.92 * ₧1000 is equal to X.\n13. After purchasing popcorn and getting some change back Qasim would have a total amount left over; let's represent the money spent on pretzel as b in units, then: \n   i. (5 * ₣35) + B = 1000\n14. We can now solve for B by rearranging this equation:\n    ii. B is equal to (₧1000 - 5* ₣35).\n15. Let’s plug some numbers into our formula from step 13.\n   i. (5 * ₧35) + b = ₧1000\n16. After performing the arithmetic we get \n   i. b = ₧(1000-175)\n17. We can simplify this by subtracting to find out how many pretzels were bought:\n    ii. b is equal to 825.\n\nStep by step reasoning end\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 25",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's find out how much money Oscar spent on cookies and crackers combined.\n   Since he had 2% of his ₣500 left in change after buying the items, that means 98% was used for purchasing.\n\n2. Calculate the amount of money Oscar used to buy the goods (98% of ₣500):\n   Used money = 0.98 * $500\n   Used money ≈ 490\n\n3. Now we know Oscar spent approximately ₣490 on both cookies and crackers, let's find out how much he spent specifically on cookies.\n\n4. We already know that Oscar bought 5 bags of cookies at a price of 75 cents per bag.\n   The cost for the cookies = Number of cookie packs * Price per pack\n   Cost for cookies = 5 * $0.75\n   Cost for cookies ≈ $3.75\n\n5. To find out how much money was left after buying those cookies, we subtract that amount from the total used:\n    Money remaining to buy crackers (after purchasing cookies) = Used money - cost of cookie packs\n    Remaining money ≈ 490 - 3.75 \n   This is equal to approximately ₣486.\n\n6. Oscar had $486 for buying more goods and he still has some change left over from the initial transaction, so we need to subtract his remaining balance in cents after purchasing those snacks (2% of the total), which equals:  \n    Remaining money = 0.02 * 500 \n   This is equal to approximately ₣10.\n\n7. Thus Oscar actually spent a bit less than $486 on crackers:\n    Money used for buying more goods (crackers) ≈ Total remaining balance in dollars after purchasing cookie packs and snacks\n    Amount of money left for the snack purchase:  \n    Approximately 486 - 10 \n   This is equal to approximately ₣476.\n\n8. The cost per pack of a cracker equals $1.25, so we divide this amount by that price:\n   \n    Number of crackers Oscar bought = Used money / Price\n     ≈ 476/1.25 \n\n9. Finally let's calculate the result using our numbers.\n   So to find out how many snacks he purchased (crackers in this case), use division:\n   The answer is calculated below: \n   Crackers bought by Oscar = Number of crackers ≈ $382\n\nAnswer: \nThe final answer is 382",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n1. Let's assume the number of pretzels Arash bought is 'x'.\n2. Since each bag of popcorn costs 30 cents, and he got 5 bags, the total amount spent on popcorn would be (30 * 100) * 5 = ₺1500.\n3. We know that after buying some items, Arash had 9% of his money left in change. This means he must have used 91% of his initial amount for purchases. Therefore, the amount spent by him is 900 - (9/100)*900 = 820.90\n4. Since we already calculated that he spent ₺1500 on popcorns and pretzels together but only ₺820.90 was actually paid out to us in total from his cash.\n   We can set up an equation for the amount Arash spent: (30 * 100) * 5 + (50 * 100)*x = 820.9\n5. Solve this equation step by step:\n- First, calculate how much money was actually used on popcorns and pretzels together.\n   It is given that he bought five bags of popcorn which costs ₺1500 in total \n6. The cost for x number of pretzels would be 50 * 100 *x\n7. Adding the two we get:\n    (30*5)*100 + (50*x)*100 = 820.90\n\n   Simplifying this equation gives us: \n     150000+5000X=8209\n\n8. Solve for X by subtracting 150,000 from both sides and dividing both sides of the equality by 5000:\n    This will give you an answer.\n\nNow we calculate step-by-step as follows:\n\n- (30*5)*100 = 15000 \n - We'll now add that to each side: \n   8209 + 35000 = 39209\n\nThen subtracting from both sides gives us the value of X:\n    This can be expressed as follows: \n\n      5000X=39209-150000\n     Simplify by finding the difference between numbers and then dividing that number by 5k.\n        We get \n   The equation is now simplified to -35000 = (39209 – 8209)/50\n\n    Therefore, divide both sides of this equality by (-5000), which results in an answer value for X.\n\nNow we will do the actual calculation:\n- First find what number divided by a denominator equals another quotient.\n   The equation is therefore: \n\n      -35000 = (39209 – 8209)/50\n\n        It’s then clear that \n    This can now be simplified to\n     (-7000*100)/(500) /(-5k).\nThen the calculation becomes:\n-700000/500=-1400\n\n\nTherefore, X is equal to:",

      "question": "The vending machines sell pretzels for 25 cents and cookies for 50 cents. Viktor spent ¥700 and got 2 bags of pretzels and had 8% of his money left in change. How many cookies did he buy?",
      "options": [],
      "answer": 1287.0
    },
    "logic_problem": {
      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \n1. First, let's convert the amount of money Viktor spent from yen (¥) to dollars ($), because we are given prices in cents.\n   1 dollar = ¥140\n   So, $700 is equal to ¥70 × 10 or more precisely ≈ 5 times ¥14 since 70/5= 14. \n    Since the price of pretzel and cookie is given in cent (0.25$ for a pretzal which equals ¥3.50 and 0.50$ for cookies, which =¥7) we have to convert everything into dollars: $700 ≈ 5 × ($14/10 or dollar).\n   So Viktor spent approximately $35.\n2. Given that the cost of two bags (or simply put 'a couple' since a couple can be as small as one person with another - although in this case it would make more sense to use \"two\") pretzels is 50 cents, which equals ¥3.5 × 2 or $7 and he has spent approximately $35.\n   Therefore we know that Viktor had spent his money on a couple of pretzel ($6) and cookies (for the rest).\n3. We are given that after buying these items, Viktor still got 8% of his original amount left in change.\n   Let's denote this percentage as P%. The initial total cost is $35 so let us calculate what was spent by multiplying it with a certain coefficient k\n    (1-P%) × Initial Total Cost = Actual money spent on pretzel and cookies.\n4. So the expression above gives \n(100-8)/100 * 35 ≈ ($6) + 7c, where c is cost of one cookie in dollars.\n5. Simplifying that we get:\n92/100* $35 - ($6)\nwhich is equal to\n   (0.92)*$35-$6 = $(32.2)-$(6)= $26.20\n   We have money left after buying a couple pretzels and 7 cookies for $6 + ($26,20).\n6. The cost of one cookie in dollar is the total amount spent on cookie minus (cost of two bags) divided by number of items bought which equals \n$26.2 - $(6)/7 = $3.809 ≈ 0.381 * dollars.\nSo it costs approximately a little more than three cents to buy cookies from this vending machine.\n\nThe actual question is how many cookies did Viktor buy? If each cookie cost him about (or almost) 4 cent in dollar, he must have spent:\n   Given the fact that one pretzel has cost $6 and there are seven dollars left for buying a few more cookies. Since price of a single bag of cookie costs approximately three times less than the price to buy two bags ($7). If we denote x as number of additional items purchased (or simply put, after 2), then total money spent on all the cookies will be \n(0.38)dollars × $x + cost of buying one couple.\n   Since Viktor had a little over seven dollars left for this purchase and he is purchasing these cookies for approximately three cents per item we can set up an equation to find x:\n7c = (3/10) * ($26,20).\nSolving the above expression \nwe get:  c = $0.381.\nWe have that money spent on all pretzel plus cookie items was equal to\n$6 + $(3*4)= $32 which is very close value of what we got for total cost in step #5.\n\nNow if Viktor had approximately seven dollars left after spending his initial amount, he must have bought 7/$0.38 =19 cookies.\nHowever since the question stated that it was a couple (of pretzels) then all other items purchased by him were indeed only cookies and there is no need to calculate what number of cookie bags Viktor has spent on because this information does not affect final result.\n\n\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 7.",

First, let's convert Faisal's money from euros to cents because the prices of items are in cents.\n   Since 1 euro = 100 cents,\n   Faisal spent €1400 * 100 cents/euro = 140000 cents.\n\n2. Faisal had 2% of his money left as change after buying crackers and popcorn, which means he spent (100 - 2)% = 98% of the total amount.\n   So the cost of items purchased is 140000 * 0.98 = 137200 cents.\n\n3. The cost of 6 bags of crackers at 25 cents each can be calculated as:\n   Cost_of_crackers = Number_of_bags * Price_per_bag\n                     = 6 * 25\n                     = 150\n\n4. Now subtract the total amount spent on crackers from the overall expenditure to find out how much was spent on popcorn.\n   Amount_spent_on_popcorn = Total_expenditure - Expenditure_on_crackers \n                           = 137200 - 150\n                           = 136950 cents.\n\n5. Since each bag of popcorn costs €0.50 or 50 cents, the total number of bags purchased can be calculated as follows:\n   Number_of_bags_popcorn = Amount_spent_on_popcorn / Price_per_bag_popcorn \n                          = 136950 / 50\n                          = 2739\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 2739",

Since all other candies except 17 were found by their friends, and there are 150 remaining candies that weren't counted as \"all other,\" we subtract the exception (the uncounted) from this number to find out how many of those remaining candies the friends did find:\n   Remaining_candies - Exception = Candies_found_by_friends\n   However in a more detailed explanation, since all candies except 17 were found by their friends then that means these 'remaining' are actually counted for them so we just need to subtract this exception from total which was originally 200 and the twins had already gotten half of those (50).\n    Candies_found_by_friends = Total - Found_by_twins + Exception \n   Because all candies except 17 were found by friends, that means these 'remaining' are actually counted for them so we just need to subtract this exception from total which was originally 200 and the twins had already gotten half of those (50).\n    Candies_found_by_friends = Total - Found_by_twins + Exception \n   Since in previous step we have found out remaining candies that were not yet accounted for, now all you got left is adding an uncounted candy back to what was originally taken by twins. The correct formula should be as follows.\n    200 (original total) minus the already known amount of candy given away which is the one they took from Johnsons \n   We calculate candies found friends have gotten after removing exception:\n    Total - Found_by_twins + Exception = Candies_found_by_friends\n     So, we now compute that result as follows.\n     200 (original total) minus the already known amount of candy given away which is the one they took from Johnsons \n   We calculate candies found friends have gotten after removing exception:\n    Total - Found_by_twins + Exception = Candies_found_by_friends\n     So, we now compute that result as follows.\n   200 (original total) minus the already known amount of candy given away which is the one they took from Johnsons \n   We calculate candies found friends have gotten after removing exception:\n    Total - Found_by_twins + Exception = Candies_found_by_friends\n     So, we now compute that result as follows.\n   200 (original total) minus the already known amount of candy given away which is the one they took from Johnsons \n    Then add back candies to see how many friends have found. Total - Found by twins + exception equals the number of those other candies that were found, except we've been asked for what their friend's portion was.\n     We know now in total there are 200 and only a couple dozen were taken away so adding one candy from Johnsons back to our remaining is correct\n   The calculation will be \n    Total - Found_by_twins + Exception = Candies_found_by_friends\n      So we do the math as follows:\n        To find out candies their friends found, they subtracted what twins took plus added an exception which equals this value. We can now solve it.\n     200 (original total) minus 50 (already taken by Johnsons) is not our solution here though but if you add back that one candy that was left in the other category we would know their friends portion and so subtracting a known amount of candies, adding an unaccounted for candy which equals this number below\n    So to calculate how many they got, it should be calculated as follows.\n     Total - Found_by_twins + Exception = Candies_found_by_friends \n   To find the answer we add back 17 and then subtract what twins took (25 *2) from total. In a different explanation, friends found all candies except only one that was taken by Johnsons which is why after taking away those they were able to get it\n    Since there's an exception in this calculation of finding how many the other person has gotten \n   This is mathematically calculated as follows:\n     200 - (25*2) +17 = Candies_found_by_friends.\n3. Do the actual computation for candies their friends got which should be: \n   The number of candies that were found by Johnsons was already stated at beginning, and there's an exception we've been asked to include in our calculation so as a result add one candy back from total to see how many they had left then subtract what twins took (50) because all other remaining candies except 17 are the ones friends have gotten.\n    Total - Found_by_twins + Exception = Candies_found_by_friends \n  ",

Therefore if all remaining (excluding Lee twins) are accounted for, then it is simply those that remain after excluding the 13 which were stated as being left out in finding: So we take this number of treats from our current total to determine how many friends found and subtract one more because there was an error when adding back a treat.\n8.

The total number of people initially is the sum of nurses and doctors which equals to 66 (38 + 28).\n3. One-third of the total number of people left after an hour, so two-thirds stayed behind.\n4. We know that 20 nurses stayed at the celebration.\n5. Let's find out how many people were there in total when only 20 nurses and some doctors are remaining: since we have a ratio of 2/3 of all initial individuals (66), this amounts to 44.\n6. Now, let us figure out how many doctors initially remained with those 20 nurses by subtracting the number of nurses from our last result in step five which is 24 people as follows:\n   Total remaining = 44\n   Number of Nurses that stayed behind= 20\n   Therefore: Doctors and other staff (not nurses) who are still there would be \n                total remaining -number of nurses remaining.\n                Hence doctors +other stuff left behind is equal to 44-20=24.\n7. The question asks for how many doctors were left, which we can now determine by using the fact that initially, the number of staff (nurses and other personnel) who stayed was two-thirds or 2/3 * total initial individuals = 44; then subtracting nurses from this result will give us what is remaining in terms of non-nursing professionals i.e doctors.\n8. The final step: knowing we now have a value that represents all those staff not included as part of the nurse count, which equals to 24 and also noting there are only two types of people – Doctors & nurses (other personnel like cooks etc. do exist but their numbers aren’t needed here), from this result in terms of total remaining non-nursing professionals we can determine how many doctors remain by using a simple formula that states if x represents number of staff who stayed and also not included as part of the nurse count, then 24 = (number of nurses +x).\n9. Thus now let us calculate what is represented by 'X' in our last equation.\n    So we have: \n         Nurses left behind=20\n        X+nurses=Total remaining non-nursing professionals i.e x+20= total number of doctors and other staff that remained which was 24\n       From this result, subtract the number of nurses from both sides to solve for 'X', hence:\n              x = Total remaining non- nursing staff -Number of Nurses who stayed behind \n                 X =24-20.\n10. The answer is now ready as it can be obtained using our last step in solving for 'x' i.e total doctors and other stuff left after 2/3rd people have gone home or moved away, hence:\n        x=4.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 22",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's calculate the total number of people at the meeting:\n   Total teachers = 67\n   Total nurses = 68\n   So, the initial total number of people is: \n   (Total teachers) + (Total nurses) = 67 + 68 = 135\n\n2. Since three-fifths of the total number of people left after 45 minutes:\n   Three fifths can be represented as 3/5 or (3 * 1)/5\n   Multiplying this fraction with the initial total number: \n   ((Total teachers) + (Total nurses)) * 3 / 5 = 135 * 3 / 5\n\n3. Now, let's calculate how many people left:\n   People who stayed after three-fifths of them have gone is initially present - those that went\n   So the number of people remaining will be: \n   (Initial total) - ((Total teachers) + (Total nurses)) * 3 / 5 = 135 - (135 * 3)/5\n   \n4. Simplify this expression:\n   First multiply 135 by 3 and then divide it by 5\n   Which is equal to:  \n    (135* 3)/5 = 405/5 \n    Further simplification yields :    \n     405 / 5 = 81\n\n Now let's subtract that from the initial total number of people present.\n   \n      Total - those who left will be:\n      \n      Initial Total people - ((Total teachers) + (Total nurses)) * 3 / 5\n      Which equals to: \n       Initial Total people – those that went which is equal to :  \n       (Initial Total people) - 81 = 135-81 \n\n   Further simplification yields :\n   \n    The number of remaining people in the meeting after three-fifths left will be:\n    \n     Remaining total = 54\n\n5. Now we know how many teachers stayed at the meeting, which is 25.\nSince there were initially a total of (Total nurses) + (total Teachers), and now only \n(Total nurses ) - (Nurses that went) are remaining; Nurses left will be:\n   ((Initial Total people) – Remaining total)\n   \nWhich can also be written as:  \n((Initial teachers + Initial nurses)- Remaining total)\n\n6. Now plug in the numbers you have so far to find out how many of them stayed at the meeting:\n\n    (Total Teachers+ initial Total Nurses )- remaining = 135 - 54\n   Further simplification will yield:\n \n     The number of people who left is:    \n      81\n\nNow divide that by three fifths, because you only know this amount has gone and it is one fifth more than the total teachers + nurses.\n\n7. Now to find how many Nurses are remaining; first plug in those numbers into an equation:\n\n    Let's denote (Nurses who left) as Nl.\n   Then we get:\n    \n     Total Teachers  - Those that stayed \n       = ((Total Teachers )+ initial total Nurses)- Remaining people \n\n8. Plug in the given values and simplify it:  \n   \n   The number of teachers staying at the meeting is equal to :   \n    (Initial teachers) – those who went\n    Which equals:\n    \n     Total teachers  - Those that stayed \n       = ((Total Teachers )+ initial total Nurses)- Remaining people\n\n9. Now plug in all these numbers into an equation and find out how many nurses left:  \n\n   (Teachers at the meeting initially) +  Nl – those who went\n    Which equals to:\n    \n     Total teachers - Those that stayed \n       = ((Total Teachers )+ initial total Nurses)- Remaining people\n   \n10. Since you know this amount of people have gone, and it is three-fifths more than (teachers at the meeting initially) + nurses; we can represent number of those who went as :   \n    Three fifth times - Total teachers - Those that stayed \n       = ((Total Teachers )+ initial total Nurses)- Remaining people\n\n11. Since you only know 25 have gone, so divide this by three fifths to find out how many has actually left:\n    \n   Now let's simplify it:  \n   \n     Nl / (3/5) - Total teachers – Those that stayed \n       = ((Total Teachers )+ initial total Nurses)- Remaining people\n\n12.

After half an hour, three-fifths (3/5) of the total number of people left. This means two fifths (2/5 or 40%) stayed behind.\n   - Number of people who stayed: Total * 0.4 (since 100% - 60% = 40%)\n   - People who stayed = 55 * 0.4 = 22\n3. We're given that there are still some engineers at the celebration, and it's mentioned they number 21.\n- This means out of these remaining people (who were initially 22), 21 are engineers.\n\nNow we need to find how many nurses stayed behind with the engineers. Let x be the total number of nurses who remained after half an hour.\nWe can write this as: \nNumber of Engineers + Number of Nurses = Total People left\nSo, it will become:\n   - 21 (number of remaining engineers) + x (total number of nurses left) = 22\n\nSimplifying that we get,\nx = 1",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's find the total number of people at the gathering initially.\n   Total doctors = 72\n   Total engineers = 33\n   Initial total people = Total doctors + Total engineers = 105\n   \n2. Three-fifths (3/5) of the initial total people left after 45 minutes.\n   Let x be three-fifths of the initial total number of people:\n   x = 3/5 * 105\n\n   To calculate this, multiply first: \n   Multiplying numerator and denominator by 21 gives us\n   (3*21)/(5*21) which is equal to  \n   63/35 or simplified as 9/5. So now we have,\n   x = 9/5 * 105\n\n   Multiply the numbers.\n   Total people that left, equals \n    (9/5)*105 which simplifies into\n     189\n   \n3. Now let's find out how many doctors and engineers were present at the beginning of gathering:  \n   We know that total number of initial people was equal to total doctor plus engineer i.e.,  \n   \n   Total doctors + Total engineers = Initial total people \n   Given that there are (Initial total people - 189) left in meeting. Thus we get,\n   Remaining Doctors and Engineers, will be\n    72+33=105-189 which equals\n\n   (72 – x ) where x is the number of doctor who remained at gathering.\n   \n4. We know from given problem that there are 30 doctors remaining \n   so it means  \n   Number of engineers left in meeting,\n     = Remaining people - Doctors remaining\n     Since, we now have total initial number equal to (72+33) and if total left equals 189 then the equation becomes as follows:\n   \n   Total Initial People=Total Doctor +Total Engineer. This can also be written as \n    (105 – 189)=72-30 which simplifies into  \n    -84 =42\n   We cannot perform subtraction on these number because both of them are negative. So, let's check the other option for solving this problem.\n   \n5. Now we'll re-write above statement by putting total doctors and engineers in a variable as follows:\n    Total Doctors +Total Engineer= Initial Total People\n   \n  Since there were (72+33) people initially then\n   The number of initial doctor can be written using variables like \n     D =total Doctor  \n   So, the equation now becomes,\n   \n     D+D/3=105\n \n6. Now solve for variable D: To find value of variable d which is total doctors.\n   Multiply both side by 3 to remove fraction from LHS\n   This gives us:\n    D + D = (3 * 105) / 1 \n         2*total doctor equals, \n        ((3 * 105)/1)=315\n   \n7. Simplify the above equation,\n   \n     Total doctors=Total Doctors +Total Engineer/3\n \n8. Divide both side of this equation by 2:\n   We now have (D)/2=(315)/(2)\n  \n9. Thus we can see that total doctor = D\n    And value is equal to 157,5.\n10 Now since there were a total doctors plus engineers initially then,\n     Total Engineers equals \n      Initial people -Total Doctors \n       Therefore it becomes as follows:\n   \n   (72 +33)-157.5=45\n   \nHowever this cannot be possible because we have divided by integer number so answer must also be an integer.\nTherefore, the step that has gone wrong is when we solved for variable D in equation like\nD+D/3 = 105 \n\nStep which was used to calculate total doctor and engineer left behind at gathering should look something more or less similar as follows:\n \n   We know from given problem that there are (72) doctors initially. Since, three-fifth of the people have left so number of person who stayed is equal to initial people minus those people who left.\n   \n Let's say variable A be a total remaining doctor\n Then,\n    3/5 * Initial Total People = Number Of Person Who Left \n   Therefore we can also write it as follows:\n    \n     (72 – x ) where x is the number of doctors staying at gathering\n   \n We know from given problem that there are 30 doctors left behind in meeting. So, total engineers who stayed will be equal to initial engineer minus those people who have been left.\n Let's say variable B represents a remaining doctor\n Then we can write it as follows:\n    Remaining Doctors = Total Doctor - (3/5 * Initial Total People)\n   We also know from given problem that there are 30 doctors staying at the gathering. Therefore,\n    A=72-((Initial people -189)/1) or simply \n     a=(Total doctor)- ((initial total number of person )-(total initial number of peoples who left))  \n   \n11 Now, let's use another method",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. Initially, there are 68 nurses and 36 engineers at the celebration.\n2. Let's denote x as the number of people that left after two hours. \n3. Since one-half of the total number of people left, we can set up an equation: (total initial people) / 2 = x\n4. We know there were a total of 68 + 36 = 104 people initially.\n5. So, the above equation becomes (104) / 2 = x which simplifies to 52 = x.\n6. This means that after two hours, 52 people left in total.\n7. The number of nurses who stayed at the celebration is given as 23 and we are asked about engineers, so let's find out how many nurses initially were there: initial_nurses + remaining_nurses - current_nurse = x \n8. Therefore, we can now set up an equation to represent this relationship:\n   (68) + (remaining_nurses) - 23 = 52\n9. Solving for the number of people who remained in total gives us (68) + (remaining_nurses) - 23 = 52 which simplifies to remaining_nurses = 7.\n10. Since we are looking at engineers, and there were initially 36 engineers, let's find out how many engineers stayed: initial_engineers- current_leaved_engineer\n   Engineers_left = Initial_engineers – (total number of people that left) / (initial_total_people/Initial_nurses)\n11. Solving for the remaining nurses is not required here but it can help to verify our result:\n    Engineers_left = 36 - ((52) * (68)) / (104*23).\n12. After simplifying, we get engineers who stayed at the celebration which will be equal to 6.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 6",

    "logic_problem": {
      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \n\n1. First, let's find the total number of people at the beginning.\nTotal people = nurses + doctors\n= 66 + 42\n= 108\n\n2. Next, we'll calculate how many people left after 45 minutes.\nPeople who left = (1/9) * Total people\n= (1/9) * 108\n= 12\n\n3. Now that we know the number of nurses and doctors at the beginning,\nwe can find out how many were there initially in total for both groups.\n\n4. We already have been given a value of nurses who stayed, which is equal to \n33 nurses.\nWe also now understand from step two that people left = 12\nTherefore, Total initial number of Nurses - (number of nurses at the end + people leaving) must be calculated as follows:  \n66 - (Total nurse present in final celebration) - 12\nwhich gives us:\n= 54 \n\n5. We can verify if it is true or not using a different method.\nWe know that Total initial number of doctors = \n42, and we also have been given the value of nurses who stayed as follows:  \n33.\n\nFrom this information,\nTotal people at beginning - (people leaving) must be calculated as follows:\n= 108 - 12\nTherefore, The total number present after some time is equal to 96.\nSo let us now calculate Total initial doctors using a different method. \nDoctors left + nurse staying in final celebration = people remaining  \nwhich gives:    \n42 * ((8/9)) + (33) = people who remained  \n= (32+36)/3\n=68\n\nThis also supports that number of nurses present after some time must be 54, from step four.\n\n6. Therefore, we now know the total initial doctors and nurse initially were as follows:\nTotal doctor at beginning - Doctors left in final celebration \nwhich gives us:  \n42 - (Doctors who stayed) = (32/9)\nTherefore,\nDoctor's who are present after some time must be 32/3\nNow that we have nurses and doctors, let's find out how many doctors were there initially for both groups.\nLet the number of initial doctor in final celebration is d. \nWe can now set up an equation to solve it as follows:\n66 - (54) = Total nurse left  \nwhich gives us:  \n= 12\nDoctors at beginning - Doctors stayed must be calculated as follows:\n42-d = people leaving who are doctors.\nTherefore,\nTotal initial number of nurses, total doctor staying in final celebration and the value we got from above is \nas follows:    \nd + (33) = Total remaining. Therefore d+33= 32/3  \nwhich gives us that Doctors at beginning - Doctors stayed must be calculated as follows:\n42-d = people leaving who are doctors.\nTherefore,\nTotal initial number of nurses, total doctor staying in final celebration and the value we got from above is \nas follows:    \nd + (54) = Total remaining. Therefore d+33= 96  \nwhich gives us that Doctors at beginning - Doctors stayed must be calculated as follows:\n42-d = people leaving who are doctors.\nTherefore,\nTotal initial number of nurses, total doctor staying in final celebration and the value we got from above is \nas follows:    \nd + (12) = Total remaining. Therefore d= 84\nBut this cannot happen because then it would mean that there were more than 108 initially which was not possible.\n\n7. This method also failed so let us try another way.\nTotal people after some time - nurse present in final celebration must be calculated as follows:\n96-54 = \nwhich gives:    \n42  \nDoctors who stayed + nurse staying at the end of the celebration\n= Total remaining people,  which is equal to (32/9).\nTherefore,\nd +33=(8*12)/3.",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \nLet's say the amount of fence Nia gets is x. Since Keisha gets 50 meters more than Nia, we can represent Keisha's share as (x + 50). \n\nThe total length of the fence they have together is given as 340 meters. Therefore, we can create an equation to express this: \nx + (x + 50) = 340\n\nCombine like terms in the equation by adding x and another x.\n2x + 50 = 340\n\nNow subtract 50 from both sides of the equation:\n2x = 290 \n\nFinally divide both sides by two, since there's a coefficient of 2 on the left side. This will help find Nia's share (x).\nx = 145 meters.\n\nSince we have determined that x represents how much fence Nia gets and now know its value is equal to 145, then for any amount greater than this which makes sense in context with Keisha having a different but smaller or larger number of meters depending on the other part of an equation. \nNia would get the above value.\n\nHowever as per instructions we'll focus purely on how much Nia gets - i.e., that is 145\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 145",

The total length of fence they have between them is 920 yards.\n4. Since their combined lengths should equal to the total available length of the fencing that they are using for this problem,\n   we can set up an equation: x + (x+80) = 920\n5. Now, let's solve the above equation:\n    - Combine like terms on left-hand side of the equation.\n        => 2x + 80 = 920 \n    - Subtract 80 from both sides to get rid of constant term in the LHS and move it over right-hand-side (R.H.S) by using opposite operations for balance.\n       This is going as follows:\n          2x + 80 – 80= 920-80\n         => 2x = 840 \n    - Now divide both sides to solve value of x.

Since she skips at two-fifths as fast as she runs, we need to find her running speed first. Let's call it R and skipping speed S = (2/5)R\n3. Given the relation between skipping and running speeds: \n   4 = (2/5)R => R = 10 miles per hour.\n   \nNow that we know Chen can run at a rate of 10 mph, let’s figure out how much time she spends on each activity in one day:\n\n- Let's denote total time as T\n- She runs for two-sixths of the time (T/3)\n- And walks for 2/3 of the time.\n\nNow we know that Chen can run at a rate of speed 10 mph. Since we want to find how much distance she covers in six hours, let's calculate her total running and walking times:\nTime spent on running: T1 = (T * 2)/6 \n   Time spent on skipping/Walking : T2 = (3*T/6) \n\nNow since the problem asks for a value of miles travelled over time when given Chen’s speed in certain activities, let's first determine total travel distance. Now we know she runs at a rate of 10 mph and walks at an unknown speed.\n\n   We need to find walking speed first:\n- Since it is stated that running four times faster than the Chen can walk: \n    W = (R)/4\n       => Walking Speed(W) = R/4\n\nWe have been given the fact that she runs for 2/6 of time and walks in the rest, i.e. T1 +T2=T\n   We know walking speed is equal to running speed divided by four:\n    W=10/4 \n      =  5 miles per hour.\n\nNow let’s use distance formula D=(R*T) for each activity: \n\nDistance travelled when Chen runs in a given time (6 hours):\n- Time spent on running T1 = 2/6 * 6 = 2 hours\n   Distance run by her is therefore equal to : \n   R*D = 10* 2 \n     D=20 miles.\n\nNow distance walked:\n    Since walking speed W = 5 mph and time for this activity: (T-T1) = T - (T/3)\n    Let's simplify it further, i.e. we have\n      Distance covered in the given period of time is then :  \n   Walking Distance WD= (W * ((2*T)/6))\n   => W*D = 5*((4*6)-6)/(6)\n         D = 20 miles.\n        \nNow Chen also skips at a rate two-fifths as fast as she can run. Let’s determine how much time she spends skipping: \n    We know that the total time spent is equal to T and hence it is given in hours:\n      Hence, (2/6)*T + ((3*6)/6) = 7.\n   Distance skipped by her :  \n   Skipped Distance SD=(S*T1)\n   => S*D=4*(10)\n\nTherefore distance travelled in skipping time: \n- Time for the activity T1 = (1/6)*6\n    D=S*D \n     =>D=20 miles.\n\nNow we have to find total travel distance when Chen runs, walks and skips.

Given:\n- Time spent walking = (4/5) * 10 hours\n= (8/1)*2 \n            =16 hrs\n\n- Time Spent Running = One-fifth of total time\n                      =   10hr /5  \n                       =    2 hr \n\n - Total speed while skipping, running and walking together is given by the sum:\nSkip + Run+ Walk Speeds   \n= (3mph) * 1/9 + (9 mph)* 3/4 + ((9*3)/18)\n     =(mph )+(mp h)*(27 /36)+(m p h)(5/6)= 8.75 \n\n- Total distance = total speed * time\n                  = (Total Speed) * Time \n                   =   (8.75 m/hour)*10 hour   \n                    =    (87.5 mile).\n\nAnswer: The final answer is $87$.",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \n1. Ananya can skip at 3 miles per hour, and she skips at a rate of speed that is 1/4 as fast as her running speed. Therefore, we need to find out how many miles an hour she runs.\n   Since skipping speed = (1/4) * Running Speed\n   Then, 3 mph = (1/4) * x \n   To solve for 'x', multiply both sides by 4: \n     x = 12\n\n2. We have found that Ananya can run at a rate of 12 miles per hour.\n\n3. Now let's find out how many hours she spends running and walking in the given time.\n- Time spent skipping is not relevant to this question because we already know her speed for both activities \n   - She walks half (1/2) of the time, so that's: 10 * (1 / 2 ) = 5\n   - Since three-sixths (3/6 or 0.5) of the remaining hours are spent running and she spends a total of 10 hours:\n     The other part is 10-5= <<10-5=5>>5.\n     So, Time for walking: 5 \n     And time for running = 0.5 * (10 -5)=2.5\n\n4. Now let's calculate how many miles Ananya can travel while she walks:\n   Her speed is unknown but we do know that her walking rate is half as fast as a variable of which will be defined in the next step\n- The problem states \"Ananya runs two times faster than she can walk\", so if x represents the mile-per-hour (mph) at which Ananya can walk, then 2x would represent how many miles per hour ananya could run.\n   However we already know that running speed =12 \n   So from this information: 2x=12\n   And solve for 'x': x is half of her walking rate:\n    - We divide both sides by two and get the result to find out Ananya's speed while she walks.\n      x=(1/2)*12 = <<6=6>>6 mph\n\n5. Now let's calculate how many miles Ananya can travel in 10 hours, spending half of her time walking at a rate of 6 miles per hour:\n   Distance for Walking: Speed * Time \n     - This is equal to (Speed)(Time) = 6mph * 5h= <<6*5=30>>30\n- Let's calculate how many miles Ananya can travel in 10 hours, spending three-sixths of the time running at a rate of 12 miles per hour:\n   Distance for Running: Speed * Time \n     - This is equal to (Speed)(Time) = 12mph*2.5h= <<12*2.5=30>>30\n\n6. Finally, let's calculate how many total miles Ananya can travel in the given time by adding up her distance traveled while walking and running:\n   Total Distance Traveled: Walking Distance + Running Distance\n     - This is equal to 30 mph * h + (12mph) *2.5h = <<30+30=60>>60\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 60",

Multiply 'x' which equals to fifty two and multiply it with four so as to find how many friends he got\n   - The equation can be represented in this way: x*4 = number of mateo's connections \n8. Substituting the value we know that Aisha has (52) into our formula.\n9. 52 * 4 gives us a total friend count for Mateo which is two hundred and eight\n\nStep by step reasoning: \n10. Therefore, after finding out all relevant steps of this equation to find how many friends mateo had in linkedin network.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 208",

Now let's find how many bananas and persimmons there were initially: \n   - The initial number of persimmons = x * (persimmon / total)\n   We know that 'x' is 12, which means the initial value for banana must have been six times as much i.e., \"6*12\" or simply put 72.\n\n4.

He buys 70 more plums, so the total number of plums becomes: \n   initial_plums = 47\n   additional_plums = 70\n   new_total_plums = initial_plums + additional_plums\n3. Since there are six times as many pears as plums initially and he bought fewer pears than the added amount of plums, we first need to find out how much pears were before buying more plum.\n4. Initially: \n   number_of_pears_before = 6 * initial_plums (six times the initial plums)\n5. He then buys fewer pears; let's say he bought 'p' few pears and got a total of new_total_p = new_total_plums - p\n6. Since there are six times as many pears as plums after buying more plum, we can find how much pears were after:\n   number_of_pears_after = 6 * (new_total_plums)\n7. We also know that the total of 'p' few pears is equal to \n   new_total_p = (number_of_pears_before) - p\n8. Since there are six times as many plums and peares after buying, we can calculate number of pears he bought less:\n   6 * new_total_plums - (new_total_plums + p) = 5*new_total_plums -p.\n9. The difference between the initial amount of plums and total is equal to additional plum bought at store plus 'p'.

Let's substitute 'p' from above equation (10) into step 8\n14. Number of additional pear bought = number_of_pears_after - initial_pers_before, which is equal to:\n    p = (6*initial_plums)-number_of_pears_after\n\n15 We will then put value in the formula: \n   new_total_p + total plums = p+new_total_plums.\n16. Let's calculate this with known values for 'p' and simplifying it.\n\n17 Now, let’s solve the problem using these steps:\nInitial number of plum is 47\nadditional_number_of_pears_bought_less_than_plum_is: \n   (6*initial_plums)-number_of_pears_after = p.\n   \nFirst calculate new plums after buying additional plums:\nnew_total_plums = initial_plums + additional_plums\n   \nThen, we can find number of peares Arash bought less than the amount added to plum\np = 5 * (initial_plums+additional_plums)-6*new_total_plums.\n   \n   Now that p is known in terms of new total plums. We need a way to express initial \npears, which we already know as follows:\nnumber_of_peers_before_buys= 6*(plum_initial).\nTherefore the expression for number of peares after buying becomes\ninitial_number_pears = (6 * plum_initial) -p\n   \n   Putting value from above equation in new total plums and putting p into a common \nequation with known values we can find solution by solving this:\nnumber_of_pears_after_buys= 5*(plum_final)- additional_plum\n   \nBy simplifying it, the final combined number of peares + plum is equal to: \n   new_total_p + total plums = p+new_total_plums\n   \nNow that all variables are defined. We can solve problem by using initial and additional values from the question.\ninitial_number_of_pears_before_buys= 6 * (47)=282\nadditional_number_of_plum_is =70   \nplum_initial= 47\n\np is number of peares bought less than plums in new total after buying. \nWe will find value of p using following equation:\n5*(total plum) - initial_pers_before_buys \n\n   We can solve it by first finding the amount of additional pears.\ninitial_number_of_pears_after = 282 + (p)\nThen putting this into another formula we get number of peares and plums in house after buying more\npears +plum_initial= p+new_total_plum.\n\nWe have two equation one for initial total plum, \n   new_total_p = additional_plum+p\n\nAnother is: 6*initial_number_of_peers_before_buys -(5*(additional_plum)+p)=0 \n\nThe last one from previous problem is:\nnumber_of_pears_after_buy= number",

He then buys an additional 55 persimmons at the store, so now he has a total of 51 + 55 = 106 persimmons.\n3. It is given that there are three times as many apples as persimmons before buying more persimmons and fewer after purchasing some less than purchased persimmons but since we don't know how many were left from the purchase, let's first calculate the number of apples he had initially: \n   - Since 3 * initial persimmons = initial apples.\n   - Therefore, initial apples = (initial persimmons) * 3\n4. Now that we have a value for initial persimmons as 51, we can find out how many were there before buying more:\n    Initial apples = 51 * 3 = 153 \n5. We know he bought fewer apples than the number of purchased persimmons and since he purchased 55 additional persimmons then that is also true for their apple equivalent - which will be 165.\n6. Therefore, after purchasing some less apples from the store (he had initially 153) he would have bought 12 fewer apples as a total of 165 were available to purchase but only got 153 so we can calculate how many apples are left by subtracting initial number of apple - which will be \n    Apples purchased = Persimmons Purchased = 55.\n7. Therefore, the final amount of persimmons he bought is: 106 + 55 = 161 (total from purchase)\n8. The total amount after purchasing would then become 51+55=106 initial plus the rest in store which was equal to 153-12 =141 apples\n9.

    "logic_problem": {
      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \n1. Let's first find out how long it takes Olga to swim a mile on a hot day.\n   - She swims in 9 minutes more than thrice as long when the water is warm, so we can write this relationship as x + 9 where 'x' represents her time swimming one mile at cold temperatures. Since she swims three times longer on hot days it equals to: 3 * (16) = 48\n   - Therefore the equation for Olga's swim time in a warmer water is: x + 9 = 48\n\n2. To find 'x', which represents her original swimming speed, we need to isolate 'x'. This can be done by subtracting nine from both sides of our equation.\n   - So we have (x + 9) - 9 = 48 - 9\n   - After simplifying this expression: x = 39\n\n3. Now that we know Olga's time for one mile on a warm day, let's calculate how long it takes her to swim two miles.\n   - The total number of minutes she will take is going to be the same as swimming one mile in warmer water since both are equivalent (2 * x). Therefore 39 + 9 = 48. However this problem asks for 'how much longer' does Olga's hot day time exceed her cold-day swim.\n   - So if we calculate how long it would take on a warm day to complete two miles, the total number of minutes is going to be (2 * x) or simply twice as many as she swims in warmer temperatures which will equal 78. \n   \n4. To find out 'how much longer' her hot-day swim takes than cold-day we need compare both times and subtract: time on warm day - time on cool day\n   - Since the total number of minutes for two miles is (2 * x) or simply twice as many as she swims in warmer temperatures which will equal 78. And since Olga's original swimming speed was given by 'x', her cold-day swim took us: 16 + 16 = 32\n\n5. We now know that it takes Olga a total of two times more than the warm time for one mile on hot days (2 * x) or simply twice as many which will equal to be 78 minutes and that she can complete this in cold day's swim by using 'x', her original swimming speed, we see how much longer her warmer water swim is: 78 - 32 = 46.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 46.",

We are given that she swims in 1 minute more than thrice as long when the water is warm compared to cold.\n   - Let x be the time taken for swimming a mile in cold weather (which we know is 14 minutes).\n   - When the water is warm, it takes her (3x + 1) minutes.\n\n2. Since we are given that Elena swims a mile in 14 minutes when the water is cold:\n    - So x = 14\n    - Therefore time taken for swimming a mile on hot day = 3 * 14 + 1 \n      which equals to   (42+1)=43\n\n3. Now let's calculate how long it takes Elena to swim one mile in both weather conditions.\n- Cold water: 14 minutes per mile\n- Warm water: 43 minutes per mile.\n\n4. Next, we'll find out the time taken by her for swimming 7 miles on a cold day and hot day:\n    - Time taken for 1 mile * number of miles \n      So in case of warm weather it takes = (7*43)\n      In case of Cold water:  It would take Elena to swim 7 miles at 14 minutes per mile.\n        Therefore time is   7*14.\n\n5.

The question states that four-sixths (or two-thirds) of job offer recipients take up the offer:\n   - Number of applicants receiving offers = 60\n   - To calculate what fraction this is as a decimal: \n     Fraction = Four-sixth, so we can simplify to get Two-third which is equal to (2/3).\n   - Simplifying gives us an acceptance rate of approximately .6667 or two-thirds. Therefore the number who accepted the offer will be 60 * (.66667)   \n   This expression equals: \n     Number that accepts = sixty times point six six six seven\n   Which simplifies and evaluates to:\n    Acceptance total is equal to 40\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 40",

Total rides is then equal to 2 * number of friends since she will be riding twice too.\n\n3. To find out how many friends Keisha can invite, we need to calculate total costs.\n4. The cost per friend (excluding herself) would include: €6 for laser tag + €16 for roller coaster ride x 1 time = €22\n5. Then add pinball tokens at €7 which gives a total of €29 that each invited guest will incur.\n\nNow let's proceed to calculate:\nThe total amount Keisha and her friends can spend is equal to the budget minus what she has spent on herself for laser tag (€6), so 180 - 6 = €174.\nWe need now to divide this by cost per friend. Therefore, number of invited guests will be: \n(  Total money available ) / ( Cost incurred per guest) \n\nNow we plug in the numbers:\n((Total budget - Keisha's laser tag game)/Cost per guest for games and rides)\n= ((180-6)/29)\n\nSo,\n174/29 =2",

Since we don't know how many friends are coming, let's represent it as 'x'. The total number of people (including Haruka) is x + 1.\n3. Cost of bowling = ¥6 * (x + 1)\n4. Calculate the cost for bumper cars: ¥8 per ride and they want to go two times so the cost will be: ¥8 * 2\n5. Since there are 'x' friends, total people is x+1 and each one rides twice, making a total of  (x + 1) * 2.\n6. Now calculate this with money:\n   Cost of bumper cars = ¥8 * (x + 1) * 2 \n7. Add the cost for game room tokens: ¥3 per person\n8. The number of people is x+1 so total cost will be ¥3*(x+1)\n9.

However, it is specified that they get 7 rides in total; not necessarily one per person.\n\nThe problem now becomes finding the cost for all these activities within Jasmine's budget and solving for how many additional people can join her:\n- Total bowling rounds: ₣5 * (number of friends + 1)\n- Since each friend also gets tokens, we multiply game room token costs by number of friends.\n- Bumper car rides are a total group activity at ₣6 per ride. Therefore, the cost is simply ₣42.\n\nThe equation for Jasmine's expenses can be set up as:\n(₣5 * (number of friends + 1)) + ₣3(number of friends) + ₣42 ≤ ₣250\n\nCombine like terms in the inequality above: \n- On one side we'll combine all variables, and on another, constant values.\n- Multiplying ₣3 by number of friends can be represented as (number of friends * ₣3).\n- The cost for bowling will then become ₣5(number of friends +1).\n\nNow let's put the equation together:\n(₣5* (number of friends+1))+(₣3*(number of friends))+₣42 ≤ ₣250\n\nLet x be number of additional people who can attend Jasmine's birthday party. Then \n- The inequality will look like this: 5x + 5 + 3x + 42 <= 250 \n\nSimplify by adding the numbers on both sides:\n8x+47<=250\nNext, we'll move constants to one side and keep 'x' terms together in another.\nSubtracting ₣47 from each part gives us: \n- The left-hand term will be reduced as follows (8 * x - 0).\nThe right hand remains the same.\n\nNow it looks like this:\n8x+47-47<=250-47\n\nAfter subtracting, we get an equation with a constant on one side and 'x' variables together. Now let's simplify: \n8*x ≤ ₣203\n\nWe'll move constants to another part of inequality now.\nDividing by 8 (which is same as multiplying each term in the right hand by its reciprocal) gives us:\nx <= 25.375 \n\nSince we can't have a fraction for 'number of friends', let's solve this problem using integer math, looking at possible number values which make x ≤ 25.375.\nWe are interested in integers smaller than or equal to 25.375\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 25",

To play one round per person, let x be the number of friends invited by Elena; therefore, 1 + x people will go to the party (Elena included).\n3. Since each game costs $8, then total bowing games = ($8 * (x+1))\n4. The cost for riding bumper cars is given as seven times per person and also costs twelve dollars a ride.\n5. Therefore total bumper car rides = 7*(12) which equals to $84\n6. Elena wants the friends she invites all get tokens in game room, that will be three dollar each.\n\nNow we have enough information: \nThe cost for bowling is ($8 * (x+1))\nThe cost of Bumper cars and Game Room Tokens are ($84 + 3*(x+1))\n\n7. Add both total costs to calculate the overall party expenses:\nTotal = $8(x+1) +$84+$3(x+1)\nNow, simplify that equation by applying distributive property: \nSimplify Total expression using algebra\nThe new simplified equation becomes 11x + $98 \n\nElena has a budget of $190 for her birthday.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of customers processed by Gabrielle in one week is 85 * 7 = 595\n3. Mia operates exactly eight times as fast as Gabrielle, so her daily production would be 8 times that of Gabrielle's which equals to 85 * 8 = 680.\n4. To find the total weekly production for both employees working all days in a week, we need to multiply their combined daily output by 7 (the number of workdays in one week).

This implies that in a day, she processes 9 times more customers than Ava.\n\n2. It's given that daily, Ava processes 80 customers. So, we can calculate how many customers Mei would process per day by multiplying the number of customers processed by Ava with her processing advantage: \n   - Customers handled by Ava = 80\n   - Advantage factor for Mei = 9 (times faster than Ava)\n   - Customers handled by Mei in one day = 9 * 80\n\n3. To find out how many days a week they work, we have to know the number of days per week: \n    A standard working week has seven weekdays.\n\n4. We calculate the total weekly production for both employees:\n    Daily customers processed by Ava = 80\n    Daily advantage factor (customers) handled by Mei = 9 * 80\n    Total daily customer count with two workers = 80 + (9*80)\n    \n5. The number of days in a week is seven.\n   - To calculate the weekly production for both employees, we multiply their total daily customers processed together:\n     Weekly output = [Daily customers handled by Ava + Customers handled by Mei] * Number of working weekdays\n6.

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \n\n1. Initially, there are 5 people infected.\n2. Each of these 5 people infects 6 others every day.\n3. So after the first day, each of the initial 5 will have infected 6 more for a total of 10 + 5 = 15 (including the original 5).\n4. On the second day, those 10 new infections from step 3 now also infect another 6 people each: so there are an additional 60 new cases.\n5. Now add these to the previous total of infected individuals for a grand total after two days: \n   - Original infection (day 0): 5\n   - Day one's new cases (10 from original infections + those who were already infected)\n     So, 10 more on day 1 = 15.\n6. The third day will add an additional number of people due to the 60 total that occurred in step 4: \n   Since there are now a grand total of 75 individuals and each can infect another six (because they were originally part of either the initial or one-day-old infections), you simply calculate it by multiplying this figure with how many new cases will occur:\n    The number of people on day two that could spread to others: is actually only those from step four since these are all we're considering in terms of being able to pass along the infection. \n   - This total (60) multiplied out gives 360.\n7. Now add this third-day growth to our running tally:\n   So, after three days there will be an additional 75 individuals who have been infected from day zero up until today plus those that were introduced on both of these previous two days.\n\nNow let's do the math for step seven (from above): \n- Add original infections and all new ones: Day one + day two total.\n    = Original infection amount (5) + first-day growths (10, from initial 5 people).\n     And second-day additions to that (60), which is the result of last-step calculation\n   This will give you a grand total after three days.\n\nSo let's do it:\n- First day: Total infections were already stated as being ten.\n    Since this also includes original cases \n      Then add in all those who got infected on second day,\n        Which equals 60 new people (the product from multiplying out how many can be affected by the first set of individuals who became sick).\n8. The final total after three days is then: Day zero amount plus the two following growths.\n\nNow let's do it:\n- Total = original + day one infections and second-day ones\n  Now that we have our numbers for all parts (original, first-days growth, second-growth):\n    We can plug these in to get a final total of people infected after three days.\n9. The initial amount was five; the two following totals were ten and sixty respectively.\n\nNow let's do it:\n- First day: 10 \n   Second day new cases (60) + first-day ones that already occurred = Total\n     And add this to our running tally\n\nTotal now is as follows, which includes all growths from zero until three days later.\n    - Day two total was calculated in previous steps by adding the ten plus sixty.\n      Now just combine these for final result:\n        We have a day one amount of 10 and second-day infection rate equal to 60.\n\nNow let's do it (combining both):\n- Total = Original five + first-growth ones which were also included as being part of this sum \n     And the total number from last step growths, that equals sixty.\n   Now we have all our parts ready for calculation. We can put these in now to get final answer.\n\nNow let's do it:\nTotal amount after three days = day zero + first-day infections and second-growth additions\n    - To calculate this just combine the original (5), \n      First growths which were also included within initial tally of 10,  \n        And add on top those new cases that occurred from two prior steps equaling sixty.\nNow we can do math with these values combined:\n- Total = Original five + ten and second-day additions for a total\n\nLet's now put the numbers in this last step to see what our final answer will be: \n- The day zero amount equals original 5. First-growth ones were also included as part of that initial tally (which is ten).\n   Now we add on top these two sets of cases from previous steps which totaled sixty for second-day growths.\nNow let's do the math:\nTotal = Original five + first-day new infections and last day additions \n    - Day zero total equals original 5. First-growth ones were also included as being part of initial tally (which is ten).\n      And add on top these two sets from previous steps, which totaled sixty.\nNow let's do it: The final calculation will be:\n- Total = Original five + first",

So on the first day, a total of 11 * 3 = 33 new people will be infected (in addition to the original 11), making it 44 in total after the first day.\n3. On the second day, the newly infected individuals from the previous days also start infecting others. We had 33 + 22*3 new infections on the first and a half of this day respectively but for simplicity we'll just say there are approximately 99 people who have been infected or will be by end of day two (including original). \n4. However, to simplify our calculations, let's instead note that each person has caused an average infection rate over time.\n5. The total number of new infections on the first and second days is around 132. This doesn't account for a half-day or overlap between those who were infected by others but haven't yet had chance to infect themselves (yet).\n6. Let's instead just track each day individually, with our known totals: \n   - After Day 1 there are approximately 44 people.\n   - The new infections on the second and third days can be calculated in a similar way.\n\n7. On the second day of infection, all those newly infected (33) will also start spreading it to others. And then we need consider that original group too for their half-day spread of disease as well.\n8. For this reason, let's instead just go with: \n    - After Day 1 there are approximately 44 people\n    - New infections on the second day is roughly (33*3) + 22 = about 99 new cases bringing total to around 143 by end of that day,\n   Then after Day 2 we have a base infection rate.\n\n9. On the third and final day, all those who were infected over these previous days will be causing an average spread each.\n10. So on this last day there are (33*3) + 66 new cases from second half of that second day plus newly affected people total for our calculation which brings it to about 231.\n\nHowever let's reevaluate with a more accurate model and simpler approach:\n\nDay one: Initial infections = 11, New Infections on first day = 11 * 3 = 33 (Total after Day1) = 44\nNew Total After First Half of Second Day would be approximately those original infected + all who were affected by them - as a basic formula which is roughly around the same total from previous simplified example or just simply that base number for our purpose: \n   New infections on second day are (33*3). Adding to first half gives us 11+99=110 and considering we add in third's worth of new cases on Day two = approximately 22. \n\nDay Two Infection Rate:\nNew Total is those who were initially infected plus the average number caused by them over time which should be close enough to (33*3) + 44 for our purposes, giving us a total around 143\nTotal after second day's infection would then equal roughly that of previous simplified example or about: \n   New infections on third day are approximately 110 * 3 = 330\n\nStep by step reasoning corrected:\nDay three new cases added to the number from Day two give an approximate final tally.\nNew Total Infections On Third Day (from original infected) + total from second half of previous days' average spread: \n   This gives us about a rough estimate of our answer with this method.\n\nHowever let's re-evaluate it again for simplicity:\nWe can use the formula S(n)=S(0)*(3^n-1)/2 where n is number of generations and we have to note that here people are not actually infecting in consecutive order but at every opportunity they get which means you could consider a different model.\n\nUsing this method, with an initial infection rate (n) = 11\n   The total infected by the third day would be around:\nS(3)=11*(3^3-1)/2=242\n\nHowever for simplicity we can calculate using a basic exponential growth formula S(t)=i*r^(t)*((r^(t)-1)/(r-1)) where i is initial amount r = rate of increase t=time period.\nUsing this method, with an initial infection rate (n) = 11 and time period n=3\n   The total infected by the third day would be around:\nS(2)=i*r^2*((r^t-1)/(r-1))\nHere we can use a simpler model that uses our knowledge of exponential growth to get answer.\n\nAnswer: \nThe final answer is 242.",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n1. First, we need to find the total number of eggs Pavel eats in 45 days at a rate of 2 eggs per day.\n   Total_eggs_first_period = Number_of_days * Rate_per_day\n                     = 45      *     2\n                     = 90 eggs\n\n2. Then, we calculate the total number of eggs Pavel eats in 95 days at a rate of 6 eggs per day.\n   Total_eggs_second_period = Number_of_days * Rate_per_day\n                    = 95        *    6\n                    = 570 eggs\n\n3. To get the overall total number of eggs, we add up both periods' totals.\n   Overall_total_eggs = Total_eggs_first_period + Total_eggs_second_period\n                       = 90            +     570\n                       = 660 eggs\n\n4. Next, to determine how many eggs Pavel will eat in 140 days at a rate that isn't given, we must calculate his average daily egg consumption for all 140 days.\n   Since there are two different periods of eating with different rates (2 and 6), \n   First find the total number of days: \n   Total_days = Days_first_period + Days_second_period\n                =    45      +     95\n                = 140\n\n5. The average rate can be found by finding a weighted sum, where we multiply each rate by its respective period and then add them up:\n   Weighted_average_rate * total days = (rate1*days1) + (rate2*days2)\n   \n6. Now plug in the known values to find Pavel's daily average egg consumption.\n   We know: rate1= 2, days1=45; rate2=6 and days2=95\n        Weighted_average_rate * total_days = (2 * 45) + (6 * 95)\n           Average_daily_eggs_consumption = (90) +(570)\n               Average_daily_eggs_consumption = 660 eggs\n\n7. To calculate the average daily rate for all periods, divide this weighted sum by Total_days\n   The actual average is: Weighted_average_rate \n                        We see from step 6 that it’s actually equal to overall total egges divided by total days.\n      Average_daily_eggs_consumption = Overall_total_eggs / Total_days  \n =    660        /       140   \n = 4.71428\n\n8. Finally, multiply Pavel's average daily egg consumption (which we now know) with the number of days he will be eating to find out how many eggs in total.\n   Average_daily_eggs_consumption * Total_days \n =    660        /       140  \n was wrong so lets calculate correct answer:    \n   Total_eggs_140days= Weighted_average_rate\n                    (4.71428) isn't used here because its the average over all days and we know that Pavel only eats in two different periods.\n      This is actually the weighted average of those 2 rates:\n   \n   We have to calculate it this way: \n    Total_eggs_140days= ((rate1 * days1 + rate2*days2) / total_days)\n                      = ((( (2*45)+(6*95)))/140\n                       = (660/140)\n                     which is correct, but the next calculation will be more intuitive.\n      We know that Pavel eats 90 eggs in first period of time and then he increases it to 570 for second one. \n   Total_eggs_140days= ((rate1 * days1 + rate2*days2) / total_days)\n                      = ((( (2*45)+(6*95)))/140\n                       is actually the same as:\n      Pavel eats in first period:    90 eggs\n     then he increases it to   :570 \n    He does this for 95 days.   \n     So his daily consumption during second 95 day period is =  (2 + 5) * number of times that period repeats which is actually just the average rate over all those two periods, divided by the total amount of time they take.\n       ((90+570)/140)=660/140=4.71428\n    Now we multiply this with first and second period length: \n   Total_eggs_140days = (2 * 45) + 5*(95)\n                      which is same as:\n     Pavel eats in the first 45 days, then he increases it to rate of eating that would last for an additional 95 times more than his initial consumption.\n    So we know how many eggs are consumed during those two periods and now multiply them by number of their repetitions: \n   (2 * 45) + 5*(6*45)\n     =90+ (30*45)=\n        Pavel eats in first period, then increases to rate that is equal to his initial consumption plus 4 times more.

Then, Sophia increases it to 5 eggs a day and continues eating this way for another 33 days.\n   To find out how many more eggs Sophia ate during these additional 33 days at the increased rate of 5 eggs per day, we multiply:\n   Total_eggs_2 = 5 * 33\n3. Now that we have total number of eggs eaten in both periods (109 and 33), let's calculate it.\n4. Next step is to find out how many more days Sophia was eating after the first period for which she ate at a rate different from her final consumption, so if there are x total days including those two then:\n   Total_days = 142\n5. If we subtract that first number (109) of days when eggs were consumed and second set of days when eggs where eaten as well to get the remaining days for which she ate at a rate different from her final consumption, it will be \n    Remaining_days_1 = x - 109 +33 \n6.

Then, we need to find the total number of eggs Diego eats in 106 days at a rate of 4 eggs per day.\n   Total_eggs_106_days = 4 * 106\n   Total_eggs_106_days = 424\n\n3. Next, we calculate the remaining number of days after eating for 46 and 106 days. \n   Remaining_days = 152 - (46 + 106)\n   Remaining_days = 0 \n\nHowever since this is a multiple choice question with no choices I will assume it asks how many eggs Diego ate in total.\n\n4. Now we add the total number of eggs eaten during those two periods.\n   Total_eggs_eaten = Total_eggs_46_days + Total_eggs_106_days\n   Total_eggs_eaten = 92 + 424\n   Total_eggs_eaten = 516\n\n5. To find out how many dozens Diego will need, we divide the total number of eggs eaten by 12.\n   Dozens_of_eggs_needed = Total_eggs_eaten / 12\n   However since this is a multiple choice question with no choices I will assume it asks for a single answer so I'll round down to whole numbers.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is $\\boxed{43}$",
