Since there are 20 sides numbered from 1 to 20, there are exactly 10 such outcomes (numbers 11 through 20). The total possible outcomes on one roll is 20.\n\\[ \\text{Probability of rolling > 10} = \\frac{\\text{Favorable Outcomes}}{\\text{Total Possible Outcomes}} = \\frac{10}{20} = \\frac{1}{2}. \\]\n\nStep 2:\nCalculate the probability that Santiago rolls an odd number on a single roll.
