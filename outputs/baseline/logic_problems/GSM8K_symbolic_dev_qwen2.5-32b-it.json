First, convert the length of each remora from inches to feet since the dolphin's length is given in feet.\n   - 3 inches = 0.25 feet (since there are 12 inches in a foot).\n\n2. Calculate the combined length of all 8 remoras:\n   - Combined length of remoras = 8 * 0.25 feet\n   - This equals to 2 feet.\n\n3. To find what percentage this is relative to the dolphin's body, use the formula: \n   (Combined Length / Total Dolphin Length) × 100%.\n   \n4.

Knowing that the area is given as 738 square feet and one dimension (length) is now known in feet at 18 feet, we can find out the width by dividing the total area by this length: \\( \\frac{738}{18} = 41 \\). So, the width of the room is 41 feet. Now that both dimensions are found (length and width), calculate the perimeter using these measurements. The formula for a rectangle's perimeter is P=2(l+w) where l represents length and w represents width; hence \\( P = 2(18 + 41) \\). Therefore, \\( P = 2(59) \\) which results in \\( P = 118 \\).\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 118.",

Since each jar decorates 16 brownies and she has 7 jars, this gives us a product that represents how many brownies in total will be decorated (Total Brownies = Jars * Brownies per Jar). Next, we need to figure out how these are distributed across baking sheets which can hold up to 14 brownies each. To find the number of full or partially filled baking sheets needed for all the brownies, we divide the Total Brownies by the Capacity of a Baking Sheet (Baking Sheets Needed = Ceiling(Total Brownies / Baking sheet capacity)). We use ceiling because even if there's one extra brownie that doesn't fill up an entire baking sheet, Jasmine will still need another full sheet to bake it.\n\nLet’s calculate:\nTotal number of brownies she can decorate is 7 * 16.\nThis equals to 112 brownies in total. \n\nNow we divide the total number by how many a single sheet holds: \nBaking Sheets Needed = Ceiling(112 / 14).\n\nSince 112 divided by 14 perfectly fits into whole baking sheets, no need for ceiling adjustment as it already results in an integer.\n\nThus, she needs exactly 8 full baking sheets to accommodate all the brownies.\nAnswer: The final answer is 8",

To find the total time he needs to exercise on Thursday, we first add up his workout times from Tuesday and Wednesday:\n   - Total of Tuesday + Wednesday = 36 min + 24 min\n   - This equals a combined total of 60 minutes for both days.\n3. Tara wants to exercise for thrice this amount on Thursday.\n   - Thus, the required time for Thursday's workout is: 3 * (Tuesday and Wednesday's total)\n   - That makes it: 3 * 60 min\n4. Calculating that gives us:\n   - The result of which equals 180 minutes.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 180",

Since Comet Hyakutake has an orbital period around the Sun every 80 years and it was seen by Arash a second time when he was 84, this means that since his first sighting of the comet until now (second sighting) must be one full orbit cycle which is 80 years.\n4. Therefore, to find out how old Arash was during their first viewing: \\(84 - 80 = 4\\) years.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 4",

Thus, Luca was 99 years old during his second observation of the comet.\n\nSince Comet Hale-Bopp orbits every 75 years and Luca has seen it twice at least once as a child and again at 99 years old, we can calculate how many years apart these observations were. The difference in time between seeing the comet for the first time until he saw it second is exactly one orbit period (since there are no other sightings mentioned), which equals to 75 years.\n\nTo find out Luca's age during his first observation of Comet Hale-Bopp, we subtract this orbital period from his age at the time of his last sighting: 99 - 75 = 24. \n\nAnswer: The final answer is 24.",

Since there are 8 periods in the day for other students and he takes an additional two extra classes each day, this means that each weekday, Theo has 10 class periods.\n   \n2. Each period is 55 minutes long, so we can calculate how many minutes of learning time Theo spends on one school day (Monday to Friday) by multiplying the number of class periods per day with the length in minutes: \\(10 \\times 55 = 550\\) minutes/day.\n\n3. Since he goes to classes for five days a week, we can find out how many total learning minutes Theo spends from Monday through Friday: \\(550 \\text{ min/day} \\times 5 \\text{ day/week} = 2750\\) minutes per school week (Monday-Friday).\n\n4. Next, calculate the extra time he learns on weekends by using the information that it is equal to one-tenth of his weekly learning time during weekdays: \\(1/10 \\times 2750 \\text{ min} = 275\\) additional minutes each day for Saturday and Sunday.\n\n5. Add these weekend hours together since they are spent on both days: \\(275 + 275 = 550\\) extra learning time in a week (for the entire weekend).\n\n6.

Adding this to bowling gives us $8 + $0 (assuming tokens are negligible) + $84 = $92 total per person.\n\nGiven Elena's budget is $190, we subtract the cost of her own participation which is also $92 since she would need all these things as well: 190 - 92 = $98 remaining for friends. \n\nTo find out how many friends can be invited with this amount, divide the remainder by the per person total expense ($92): 98 / 92 ≈ 1.065.\n\nSince Elena cannot invite a fraction of someone to her party and she has enough budget left only for one additional full participant without exceeding her limit, we conclude that she can invite just one friend with the remaining funds after covering all expenses including herself.\nAnswer: The final answer is 1",

So on the first day (day 1), each of those 11 individuals infects another 3 people, leading to an additional \\(11 \\times 3 = 33\\) people being newly infected by the end of day 1.\n- On the second day (day 2), all these now-infected individuals from previous days will also contribute to new infections. This means we have a total of \\(11 + 33 = 44\\) infected at this point, and each infects another 3 people: so an additional \\(44 \\times 3 = 132\\).\n- On the third day (day 3), all those now-infected individuals from previous days will also contribute. We have a total of \\(11 + 33 + 132\\) infected by this point, and each infects another 3 people: so an additional \\((11+33+132) \\times 3 = (176)\\times 3=528\\).\n\nAdding up all the infections across these three days gives us a total number of unique individuals infected by the end of day 3.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is \\(704\\)",

      "raw": "\nStep by step reasoning: We start with 6 people infected initially. Each day, the number of newly infected people increases as each previously infected person infects 4 more.\n\n- On Day 1: The initial 6 infected individuals will each infect 4 others.\n    - New infections on Day 1 = 6 * 4\n    - Total infected by end of Day 1 (including initially infected) = Initial + new for day one = 6 + (6*4)\n\n- On Day 2: The total number from the previous step now infects additional people.\n    - New infections on Day 2 will be based on all those who are already infected at this point, which is Total after Day 1 * 4\n    - We then add these new cases to our cumulative count.\n\n- On Day 3: This pattern continues. The number of newly infected in the third day depends on how many were already counted as sick by end of second day.\n    - Again multiply total from previous step times four for additional infections, and sum that with current totals to get final number after three days.\n\nLet's calculate each stage:\n\n- Day 1: Initial + new = 6 + (6 * 4) = 6 + 24 = 30\n- Day 2: Total from previous day * 5 = 30 * 5 = 150\n    - Explanation for multiplication by five instead of four is we consider all previously infected people, including the initial ones.\n- Day 3: Same logic applies. New total will be:\n    - Previous total (from end of Day 2) multiplied by same factor used before.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 750",
