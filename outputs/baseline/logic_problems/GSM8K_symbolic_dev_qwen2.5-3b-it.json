Simplify the calculation:\n   - Multiply by the reciprocal of \\( \\frac{8}{23} \\):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time} = 96\\, \\times \\left(\\frac{23}{8}\\right) \n     \\]\n\n7. Perform the multiplication and division to get an integer result for time in minutes.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 258",

To find out how many bouncy balls were in the tube, we need to subtract the initial number of other toys from this total:\n   - Total toys after adding bouncy balls = 215\n   - Initial number of non-bouncy ball toys = 74 (building blocks) + 46 (stuffed animals) + 31 (stacking rings)\n     = 74 + 46 + 31 = 151\n   - Number of bouncy balls in the tube: 215 - 151\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 64.",

Let's denote Kimia’s rate of speed while walking on the beach as \\( r \\) miles per minute. Therefore:\n   - The distance walked on the beach in terms of time is given by: \n     \\( d_{\\text{beach}} = rt = 15 \\).\n4. We know she walks at twice her rate on the sidewalk, which means if it takes \\( t_2 \\) minutes to walk 60 miles (which we'll determine later), then:\n   - The speed while walking on the sidewalk is \\( r_s = 2r \\).\n   - Therefore: \n     \\( d_{\\text{sidewalk}} = r_st_2 = 19 \\).\n\n5. We need to find out how long it takes Kimia in total for her entire walk of 34 miles:\n6. To solve this, let’s determine the time spent on each segment first.\n   - From \\( d_{\\text{beach}} = rt = 15 \\), we can express \\( t_2 \\) (time to cover the beach distance in terms of her rate):\n     \\[\n     r_t = \\frac{60}{t}\n     \\]\n7.

We substitute \\( r_t \\):\n   - From \\( rt = 60 \\), we have:\n     \\[\n     r_t = \\frac{60}{t}\n     \\]\n   So, the time spent on sidewalk becomes: \n     \\[\n     t_1 = \\frac{19}{2r} = \\frac{19}{\\left(\\frac{60}{t}\\right)} = \\frac{19t}{60}\n     \\]\n\n9.

We can equate and solve for total minutes spent on the entire walk.\n    Let's assume each mile takes a certain amount of time \\( t_m \\). Since Kimia walks at different speeds, let’s use:\n    \\[\n     60 + \\frac{19t}{60} = T\n    \\]\n   - We need to find total walking distance in terms of minutes.\n\nGiven the calculations above and simplifying for a solution:\n\nTo get \\( t_m \\):\n- Each mile is walked at different speeds:\n\\[\nT_{total} = 34(mile)\n= (60 + 19t/60) \n\\]\n\nLet's solve it by equating to find total walking time in minutes.\n\nThe final answer should be a straightforward calculation from the given information. Let’s compute:\n\nSince \\( t_m \\):\nTotal walking:\n\\[ T_{total} = 34miles * (time per mile)\n= (60 + 19t/60) \n\\]\n\nLet's assume it to get total time in minutes.\nFinal answer: Answer is 120.",

The time spent walking is proportional to distance and speed, so we can set up ratios for both parts:\n   - For the beach: \\( v = \\frac{11}{t_{beach}} = \\frac{11}{\\frac{44}{60}} \\) (since 44 minutes converted into hours gives us a total of 29 miles).\n     Solving this, we get:\n       - \\( t_{beach} = \\frac{44}{60} * 11 = \\frac{508}{60}\\)\n   - For the sidewalk: Since speed on the sidewalk is twice that on the beach (\\(2v\\)), time spent walking at this faster pace will be:\n       \\( t_{sidewalk} = v / (2v) = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{(2*speed)} = \\frac{18}{60}\\)\n     Simplifying, we get: \n       - \\(t_{sidewalk} = 3 minutes\\)\n\nNow let's calculate the total time spent walking on both parts of her trail:\n- Total distance walked is indeed 29 miles.\n- Time for beach walk (44 mins) + Time for sidewalk walk (3 mins).\n\nThe final answer: The entire 29-mile walk takes Kimia \\( 47 \\) minutes.",

The problem states that she spends 60 minutes walking on the beach out of her entire walk time.\n3.

This means if it takes \\( t \\) minutes for her to walk one mile on the beach, then it will take \\( \\frac{t}{2} = 0.5t \\) minutes per mile on the sidewalk.\n4. Since Mei walks at a rate of speed such that she covers all the miles in total (28), we can calculate how many miles are walked on each segment:\n   - Let's assume it takes her \\( t \\) minutes to walk one mile on the beach, then 60 minutes for the beach part.\n5. Since there is no explicit time given or rate mentioned specifically about sidewalk walking, let’s denote the total distance as a fraction of miles covered in different segments (beach and sidewalk), based on speed ratio:\n   - Beach: \\( \\frac{15}{t} = 60/t \\) so she walks for 2 hours (or 120 minutes) to cover the beach part.\n6.

Leilani is sure to get 40% of the geometry questions right:\n   - 40% of 20: \n     \\( \\frac{40}{100} \\times 20 = 8 \\).\n\n5. She gets 1/10 (or 10%) correctly from both history and algebra.\n   - From 10 history questions, she is sure to get:\n     \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\times 10 = 1 \\).\n   \n   - For the 10 algebra questions,\n     similarly: \n      \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\times 10 = 1 \\).\n\n6. Adding up all her guaranteed correct answers:\n   - Geometry: 8\n   - History (guaranteed): 1\n   - Algebra (guaranteed): 1\n   \n7. Therefore, the total number of points she is sure to get from this quiz is \n   \\( 8 + 1 + 1 = 10 \\).\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 10",

      "raw": "\nStep by step reasoning:\n1. First, let's calculate the total hours Oscar watched TV on Saturday and Sunday.\n   - Each night he watches a 3-hour episode: \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\) hours.\n\n2. Next, we'll consider Monday where he watched an unknown number of episodes (x) each for 15 minutes which is equivalent to one hour per episode:\n   - Total time on Monday: \\(4\\text{ hours}\\).\n\n3. Then, let's look at Tuesday when he watches a full 6-hour episode and another show that was 0.75 hours long.\n   - Total time on Tuesday: \\[6 + 0.75 = 6.75\\) hours.\n\n4. Finally, we'll consider Wednesday where he watched four episodes each of which are 4 hours long:\n   - Total time on Wednesday: \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) hours.\n\nNow let's add all the known times together and subtract from the total to find out how many hours were spent watching TV only for Monday.\n- Known totals so far: \n  - Saturday & Sunday: 6 hours\n  - Tuesday: 6.75 hours\n  - Wednesday: 16 hours\n\n\\[ \\text{Total observed time} = 6 + 6.75 + 16\\]\n\nStep to calculate remaining TV watching on Monday:\n- Total watched in all days: \\(29\\) hours.\n- Known total so far including Monday's unknown episode count (x):\n\\[ 6 + 6.75 + x \\times 4 = 29 - (\\text{unknown time for Tuesday and Wednesday})\n\n\\]\nTherefore,\n\\[ 6 + 6.75 + x \\cdot 1 = 29 - 6.75\n- So, \\(x \\times 4 + 13.75 = 29\\) \n- Solving for x: \\(x \\approx (29 - 13.75) / 4\\)\n\n\\[x ≈ (15.25)/4 \\]\n\\[x ≈ 3.8125\n\nSince the number of episodes must be a whole number, we round it to the nearest whole number.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is \\(4\\)",

Calculate how many unoccupied beds there are: Subtracting the number of occupied beds from the total capacity gives us 1500 - 410 = 1090 unoccupied beds.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 1090",

Next, we need to find out how much more money is needed after accounting for what the community center has contributed. The remaining amount required from Carlos can be calculated by subtracting the contribution of the community center from the total cost: \\( 720 - 90 = 630 \\).\n4. Finally, since we know that Carlos currently only has €125 and needs at least €630 to cover his share for the tournament, he is missing this difference.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 630",

Given that the lasagna has 27 servings and both eat at this rate (Carlos consuming 3 servings/day and Nia consuming 8 times his amount), we can calculate how many days the lasagna will last by dividing the total number of servings in the lasagna by their combined daily consumption:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of Days} = \\frac{\\text{Total Servings}}{\\text{Combined Daily Consumption}} = \\frac{27}{27}\n   \\]\n\n4. Therefore, they will finish eating all 27 servings in exactly 1 day.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 1",

Stickers were priced at $21.25 each, she bought 17 stickers:\n   - Total sticker cost ≈ $21 * 17 = approximately $360.\n\nStep by step calculation of total money spent:\n\nTotal rock candy (approximately) + sea glass: \n≈ $348 + $11.75 ≈ $369.75\n\nStickers:\n$21 * 17 = $360 \n\nSumming all expenses: approximately $369.75 + $360 = ~ $729.75.\n\nKimia's initial amount: $1300\nMoney left after purchases:\n\nFinal calculation:\n\\[ \\text{Remaining money} = 1300 - (rock candy cost) - sea glass cost - sticker cost \\]\n\\[\\approx 1300 - 369.75 - 360 ≈ 570.25\n\nAnswer: The final answer is $570",

Calculate how much Ravi will spend on sugar in a week.\n   - He uses 2 kg per day and plans to buy for a week (7 days).\n   - Total daily consumption: \\(2 \\, \\text{kg/day} \\times 1 \\, \\text{day/week} = 2 \\, \\text{kg}\\)\n   - Weekly sugar consumption: \\(2 \\, \\text{kg/day} \\times 7 \\, \\text{days/week} = 14 \\, \\text{kg}\\)\n\n3.

Calculate \\(9 \\times 99\\):\n   - First, calculate \\(90 \\times 99\\) (since it's easier to handle in multiplication by breaking up numbers)\n     \\[\n     90 \\times 99 = 8910\n     \\]\n   - Then add the remaining nine:\n     \\[\n     8910 + 9 = 8919\n     \\]\n\n4. Now, we calculate the total number of insects in the garden.\n   - Total Insects \\(= \\text{Ladybugs} + \\text{Treatment}\\)\n       \\[\n       \\text{Total Insects} = 99 + 8919\n       \\]\n       \n5. Add these numbers:\n    \\[\n    99 + 8919 = 9018\n    \\]\n\nAnswer: The final answer is \\(9018\\).",

First, we need to calculate how many plants can fit in the 144 feet of Kimia's flower bed.\n   - Each plant is planted with a space of 7 feet (width) plus an additional 12.0 feet between each other.\n\n2. Calculate total spacing needed per row of plants:\n   - Total width = Width occupied by one plant + Distance to next plant\n   - Total width = 7 + 12 = 19 feet\n\n3. Now, we determine the number of rows Kimia can fit in her flower bed.\n   - Number of rows = Length of flower bed / Space between plants per row (excluding space for each individual plant)\n   - Since there's a gap after every single plant, and she needs to add 12 feet spacing for all but one pair:\n     Total gaps needed before last plant: 10-1=9 pairs\n       Gaps = 9 * 12 = 108 feet\n\n4. Therefore, the number of rows is calculated as follows (total length divided by space per row):\n   - Number of plants in each row ≈ Length / Total width between all gaps and last plant's spacing before bed end:\n     Number of rows = (Length - Spacing needed for one less pair) / Space per row\n       Rows = 144 - 9 * 7 + 12 feet after the ninth gap divided by 19\n         After simplification, we get approximately: \n           Number of plants in each row ≈ (144-63+12)/19≈8.5\n\n   Since number of rows must be an integer:\n     We take the floor value which is 7.\n\n5.

She wants to leave a gap of 13.5 meters between each plant, but since she already has plants in her bed and we are starting from the beginning (assuming no gaps before these), this means that for every two consecutive flowers placed side by side, there will be one segment left without any flower.\n3. This leaves us with a total usable space of 189 meters - ((n-1) * 13.5) where n is the number of segments or spaces between plants (and also including the first plant). Since Quinn already has 13 flowers, she can fit an additional number of flowers without needing to leave any gaps.\n4. To find out how many more spaces are available after accounting for her existing ones: ((n-1) * 13.5) = total space - (number of plants).\n5. Let's calculate the usable segment length first, which is what we need between each plant:\n   Total space / number of segments + gaps per cycle = 189 meters\n6. The equation for calculating additional spaces and thus available planting spots: \n   Available spacing = total space - (number of existing plants * gap size)  \n7. Then calculate the remaining usable length after accounting for her initial 13 flowers:\n   Remaining segment lengths = Total flower bed length - (Number of existing plants)\n8. Divide this by the width per plant to find out how many more plants she can add: \n   Number of additional plants needed = Remaining segment lengths / Plant spacing\n9. Now, calculate total number of plants including her initial 13:\n   Total number of plants = Initial + Additional Plants Needed\n10. Finally, multiply this by the cost per plant to find out how much Quinn will spend at the store.\nStep-by-step calculation for numbers involved:\n\n- Remaining segment lengths: (189 - (13 * 13.5)) = 27 meters available for planting spots and plants in between\n- Number of additional plants needed: \n   ((Remaining segment length) / Plant spacing) + number_of_spaces_needed_between_plants)\n     => (27 / 5) ≈ 5.4, so we round down to fit exactly one more plant after the last gap.\n- Total number of plants including initial ones = Initial Plants + Additional Needed\n   => 13 + 6 = 19 total plants needed.\n\nCost calculation:\n- Cost per plant: ₣8\n\nTotal cost = Number of plants * Cost per plant \n          = (19) × (8)\nAnswer: The final answer is 152.",

Since she sauts at \\( \\frac{20\\text{ clams}}{16\\text{ min}} = 1.25\\) clams per minute, we need to determine how many batches of sautes are needed for the total amount.\n   - For 140 clams in sauté: Since she can saute a batch (of 20) every \\( \\frac{16\\text{ min}}{20} = 0.8\\text{ mins/batch}\\), we need to calculate how many such batches are required for the total amount.\n   - The number of full batches needed is \\( \\lceil \\frac{140}{20} \\rceil = 7\\) (since she needs a complete batch per saute).\n\n   Therefore, time spent on sautes alone: \n   - \\( 7\\text{ batches} * 0.8\\text{ mins/batch} = 5.6\\text{ min}\\)\n\n4.

Now that we know the dimensions are compatible with each other now:\n   Area formula: \\( \\text{Area} = \\text{Length} \\times \\text{Width} \\)\n   Given area is 630 square feet, and length is 21 feet.\n   So, width can be calculated as follows:\n   - Width = \\( \\frac{\\text{Area}}{\\text{Length}} = \\frac{630}{21} = 30 \\) feet (width of the room)\n\n3. Now we need to find the perimeter using the formula for perimeter of a rectangle, which is\n   - Perimeter: \\( P = 2(\\text{length + width}) \\)\n   \n4. Substitute in the dimensions:\n   - Perimeter \\( P = 2(21+30) = 2*51 = 102 \\) feet\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 102",

Since there's no need to break down each transaction further for this problem and considering it as a whole batch: \\( 29 \\times 3 = ₣87 \\).\n   - For daisies, he sells 40 bundles at ₣5 per bundle, so the revenue is \\( 40 \\times 5 = ₣200 \\).\n\n3. Finally, add up all revenues to find out how much Liam makes in total:\n\\[ 10 + 87 + 200 = ₣297 \\]\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 297",

We know from the problem statement that \\( R = 324 \\).\n5. Substitute \\( R = 324 \\) into the equation for Mei's score:\n   \\[\n   M = \\frac{324}{2} + 14 = 162 + 14\n   \\]\n6. Calculate the value of \\( M \\):\n   \\[\n   M = 176\n   \\]\n7. Now we need to find out how many points Roya and Mei scored in total:\n8. Summing up Roya's score (\\( R = 324 \\)) with Mei’s score ( \\( M = 176 \\)):\n   \\[\n   Total = R + M = 324 + 176\n   \\]\n9. Calculate the final answer:\n   \\[\n   Total = 500\n   \\]\n\nAnswer: The total points scored by Roya and Mei are \\( 500 \\).",

Now determine the total amount of ore mined by all goblins with diamond pickaxes over that time period:\n   - There are 22 such goblins.\n     Therefore, in a month: \\(390\\) kg/goblin \\(\\times 22\\) goblins = \\(8580\\) kgs.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 8580.",

Given that the company performed very well this month of June and Wei received a bonus each week,\n   We need to include the ₣369 bonus per week.\n   \n4. To calculate how many weeks are in June, we know it typically has either 4 or 5 complete weeks plus some extra days (leap year consideration not necessary for this calculation as our answer must be a whole number). Let's assume there are exactly 4 full weeks and then add the remaining hours to see if they meet another week criteria.\n   \n   Since Wei works every day, June has:\n   Total working days = Number of days in June * Hours worked per day\n                    = 30 (days) * 9 (hours)\n                   = 270 total work-hours\n   \n5.

In June, there are typically either exactly 4 complete weeks (80 working days - which is not the case here) or slightly more.\n\nAssuming we have exact weekly calculations and bonus included per week:\n\n- Total earnings in one full week:\n   Base salary + Bonus = 432+369\n\nTherefore total for all worked weeks including partial last half-week: \n(5 * (Total base plus bonus)) \n\nSo, final calculation is:\n(1089*4) + (Base salary and bonus of the additional hours)\n\nLet's calculate this in a clearer way:\n\n- Wei’s earnings per week = 432+369\n= 701\n\nNumber of full weeks worked: \nFull weeks in June, let us assume it is exactly 4 as partial last half-week will be included.\n\nTotal for 4 complete weeks:\nEarnings * Weeks = (4*701)\n\nThen add the bonus and additional hours:\n\nFinal answer calculation considering all days work: \n\n(432*4) + Bonus\n\n= 1689+369\n= 2058\n\nFor exact final number of total earnings in June, we need to calculate:\nTotal weeks worked including partial last week.\n\nLet’s finalize with:\n\nFinal answer is ₣12036",

Now we need to calculate the number of green cards, which are as many as the sum of yellow and orange cards:\n\n   - Sum of yellow and orange: \\(25 + 44 = 69\\).\n   \nTherefore:\n- There are 69 green cards.\n\nFinally, adding up all the card counts gives us a total of:\n  \n\\[ \\text{Total number of cards} = 25 (\\text{yellow}) + 44 (\\text{orange}) + 69 (\\text{green}) \\]\n\nLet's sum these numbers:\n\n\\[ 25 + 44 + 69 = 138\\]\n\nAnswer: The final answer is \\(138\\)",

Now, we need to find out how much more money Haruka would have by choosing the tax consultant over doing it herself.\n7. Difference in income: \n   - Income difference = Lost income + (Consultant earnings)\n   - Income difference = 712 - 552\n8. Final answer:\n   Answer: The final answer is **160**\n\nAnswer: 160",

Theo's age upon seeing it for the second time: \n\\[ x + y = 94 \\]\n7. We need to find out how many times he had seen the comet before and when that first sighting was.\n8. Let’s denote the years since his father saw it as \\( t_1 \\) (first sighting), then Theo's age at this time is:\n\\[ 2t + x = y \\]\n9. Since Theo's second sighting occurs in a period of two Comet orbits, we can set up equations based on ages and times.\n10. To find the first sighting age \\( t_1 \\):\n    - If his father saw it when he was 47 years old:\n      - The comet would have been visible to him again after another cycle (90 years) which is at 137 years old, but this isn't relevant for Theo's ages.\n    - Let’s denote the first time Theo’s age \\( t_2 \\):\n\\[ y = 4t + x \\]\n11. Given that Theo saw it a second time when he was twice his father’s initial sighting year (94), we need to find out how old he would have been at this point.\n    - Assume the first sighted comet for Theo is \\( t_2 \\):\n\\[ 2(t_2 + x) = y = 94 \\]\n12. From above, solving:\n   - The difference in years between his father’s initial sighting and Theo's second sighting: \n     \\( 94 - 47 = 47 \\)\n    - This represents the time it took for both of them to see Comet Hale-Bopp again.\n   \nSince we have seen that this is a cycle, let’s solve:\n\\[ t_2 + x = y / 2 \\]\n13. The first sighting \\( t_1 \\):\n   \\[ t_1 = 47 - (90/2) \\rightarrow t_1 = 47 - 45 = 2 years old when he saw it for the first time.\n   \nAnswer: The final answer is 2",

We know that Yusuf's grandfather was 43 years old and he witnessed Comet Encke back then.\n3. The problem states that at the second sighting (which is not specified whether this refers to a new or another appearance of the same comet), Yusuf was twice his grandfather’s age when seeing it for the first time, i.e., \\(2 \\times 43 = 86\\) years old.\n\nNow we need to calculate how long after that initial sighting, at which he would have been 86 years old in this scenario (second appearance). Given Comet Encke's orbital period is every 60 years, the time between sightings for Yusuf should be a multiple of 60 years. Since he was 86 when seeing it again:\n4. We find out how many times 60 goes into \\(86 - x\\) where \\(x\\) represents his age at first sighting.\n5. To determine \\(x\\), let's calculate: if Yusuf is twice as old in the second appearance, then he must have been older than 43 (his grandfather’s age) but not too far from it to make a significant difference when we factor in Comet Encke’s orbital period.\n\nConsidering the context and constraints given:\n6. We can set up an equation where \\(86 - x = k \\times 60\\) for some integer \\(k\\). Since \\(x > 43\\), let's find feasible values by checking multiples of 60 that fit within a reasonable range.\n7. The closest multiple of 60 less than or equal to the difference (since he must be younger at first sighting) is 80, meaning:\n\\[86 - x = 60 \\Rightarrow x = 26.\\]\nSince \\(x > 43\\) and fits within a reasonable timeframe for comet appearances, we can confirm this.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 26.",

Let's denote Viktor's age in years when he first saw the comet by \"x\".\n5. Since Comet Encke orbits every 75 years and Victor sees it again after being three times as old, we know that:\n   - The time difference between seeing the comet for the second time (when he was 96) and his grandfather's initial sighting (32) is exactly one orbit period of the comet.\n   - Therefore, \\(x + \\text{time} = x + 75\\).\n6.

After 45 minutes, \\( \\frac{1}{9} \\) of these people left. So, \\( \\frac{1}{9} \\times 108 = 12 \\) people in total left the celebration.\n3. We are told that after this number had left, there were still 66 nurses at the celebration (since 33 stayed). This means the remaining number of doctors must be calculated from the original group and subtracting those who did not leave along with all the nurses who remained.\n\nLet's calculate how many people didn't leave:\n4. Since a total of 12 left, if there were originally 66 nurses plus some unknown amount (let’s call it X) that stayed or joined initially from doctors to make up for the reduction in number, we can represent this as: \\(X + 33 = \\text{number who didn't leave}\\).\n5. From step 2 and knowing there were originally 108 people total:\n6. The equation becomes: \n   - Total remaining (nurses plus doctors) after leaving is 96 because if we subtract the number that left from the original, it's \\(108-12=96\\).\n7. If we have already established there are now 33 nurses and let’s denote the total of people who didn't leave as Y (Y = 96), then:\n   - The doctors who stayed would be: \\( \\text{Doctors remaining} = 42 - X + 33\\).\n8. Since we know that after subtracting those leaving, only 66 nurses remain and the total reduced to 96 people,\n    - We can calculate Y as follows:\n      \\[\n      (108-12) = 96\n      \\]\n   - Which is consistent since it fits our equation for remaining numbers.\n9. Thus, if we now find out how many doctors are left by using the total number of people who didn’t leave and knowing there were originally 42:\n    - Doctors remaining: \\( Y - X = 96 - (33 + \\text{X})\\).\n   - Since all nurses stayed plus some did not leave, we can infer that only those doctors initially present or added to the initial count of nurses who didn't leave.\n10. Simplify by solving:\n    - Doctors remaining: \\(42 - X = 96 - (33 + \\text{X})\\)\n      - Since Y is known and fits our equation, we can solve for doctors left directly as:\n        \\[\n         \\boxed{4}\n        \\]\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 18.",

The stock price increases by 75% in the first year:\n   - A 75% increase on ₣480 means it becomes \\(480 + (0.75 \\times 480) = 480 + 360 = ₣840\\).\n\n3.

Therefore, we can calculate the total payment by summing up:\n   - Cost of the first hour: €25\n   - Each additional hour after the 1st is three times $€25$, so it's \\(3 \\times €25 = €75\\).\n   - Faisal pays for a total of 5 hours, meaning he has to pay two extra hours at triple price (since we subtracted one free hour already):\n     - Cost for the second additional hour: €75\n     - Cost for the third additional hour: \\(3 \\times €25 = €75\\)\n     - Cost for the fourth and fifth additional hours combined are also three times each of those:\n       - Fourth additional hour cost is €75.\n       - Fifth additional hour cost is another €75.\n\nNow, let's compute it step by step:\n\n1.

Now, let's find out how many more kiwis he bought.\n   - Mohammed bought 16 fewer kiwis than the initial bananas counted (which is equal to \\( B \\)).\n   - Since \\( B = 46 \\):\n     \\[\n     K_{\\text{bought}} = 46 - 16\n     \\]\n5. Calculate how many more kiwis were bought:\n   \\[\n   K_{\\text{bought}} = 30\n   \\]\n\n6. Finally, let's find the total number of bananas and kiwi Mohammed has in his house after buying additional ones.\n   - Total number of bananas: \\( B + K_{\\text{bought}} = 46 + 30 \\)\n     \\[\n     B + K_{\\text{bought}} = 76\n     \\]\n   - Initial kiwis plus the bought kiwi total:\n     \\[\n     K_{\\text{initial}} + K_{\\text{bought}} = 230 + 30\n     \\]\n\n7. Calculate the combined number of bananas and kiwis:\n    \\[\n    B_{total} + K_{total} = (46 + 30) + (230 + 15)\n    \\]\n   - Note that we have already calculated \\( K_{\\text{bought}} = 30 \\), so for the last part, subtracting kiwis bought from initial:\n     \\[\n     K_{total} = 246\n     \\]\n\n8. Combine both totals to get the final combined number of bananas and kiwi in Mohammed’s house.\n    \\[\n    B_{total} + K_{total} = 76 + 250 = 326\n    \\]\n\nAnswer: The final answer is \\(326\\).",

So, if we let \\( x \\) represent the time it takes for her to swim a mile when it's cold (x = 16), then:\n   - The time she swims a mile in warm water would be \\( 3x + 9 \\).\n5.

According to the problem, Haruka operates eight times as fast as Yara but does not necessarily mean they work at different speeds during their shifts; it just means she processes orders more quickly when working.\n3. Since we are looking for daily production and each person works all days of the week (implied), let's first determine how many customers Haruka serves in a day:\n   - Yara serves 90 customers per day.\n   - If Haruka operates eight times as fast, she will serve \\(8 \\times 90 = 720\\) customers per day.\n4. Now we calculate the daily production for both:\n   - Yara's daily production: 90 customers/day\n   - Haruka's daily production: 720 customers/day\n5. To find their weekly (seven-day) productions, multiply each by seven days:\n   - Yara's total weekly production: \\(90 \\times 7 = 630\\) customers/week\n   - Haruka's total weekly production: \\(720 \\times 7 = 5040\\) customers/week\n6.
