Simplify the calculation:\n   - Multiply by the reciprocal of \\( \\frac{8}{23} \\):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time} = 96\\, \\times \\left(\\frac{23}{8}\\right) \n     \\]\n\n7. Perform the multiplication and division to get an integer result for time in minutes.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 258",

To find out how many bouncy balls were in the tube, we need to subtract the initial number of other toys from this total:\n   - Total toys after adding bouncy balls = 215\n   - Initial number of non-bouncy ball toys = 74 (building blocks) + 46 (stuffed animals) + 31 (stacking rings)\n     = 74 + 46 + 31 = 151\n   - Number of bouncy balls in the tube: 215 - 151\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 64.",

Let's denote Kimia’s rate of speed while walking on the beach as \\( r \\) miles per minute. Therefore:\n   - The distance walked on the beach in terms of time is given by: \n     \\( d_{\\text{beach}} = rt = 15 \\).\n4. We know she walks at twice her rate on the sidewalk, which means if it takes \\( t_2 \\) minutes to walk 60 miles (which we'll determine later), then:\n   - The speed while walking on the sidewalk is \\( r_s = 2r \\).\n   - Therefore: \n     \\( d_{\\text{sidewalk}} = r_st_2 = 19 \\).\n\n5. We need to find out how long it takes Kimia in total for her entire walk of 34 miles:\n6. To solve this, let’s determine the time spent on each segment first.\n   - From \\( d_{\\text{beach}} = rt = 15 \\), we can express \\( t_2 \\) (time to cover the beach distance in terms of her rate):\n     \\[\n     r_t = \\frac{60}{t}\n     \\]\n7.

We substitute \\( r_t \\):\n   - From \\( rt = 60 \\), we have:\n     \\[\n     r_t = \\frac{60}{t}\n     \\]\n   So, the time spent on sidewalk becomes: \n     \\[\n     t_1 = \\frac{19}{2r} = \\frac{19}{\\left(\\frac{60}{t}\\right)} = \\frac{19t}{60}\n     \\]\n\n9.

We can equate and solve for total minutes spent on the entire walk.\n    Let's assume each mile takes a certain amount of time \\( t_m \\). Since Kimia walks at different speeds, let’s use:\n    \\[\n     60 + \\frac{19t}{60} = T\n    \\]\n   - We need to find total walking distance in terms of minutes.\n\nGiven the calculations above and simplifying for a solution:\n\nTo get \\( t_m \\):\n- Each mile is walked at different speeds:\n\\[\nT_{total} = 34(mile)\n= (60 + 19t/60) \n\\]\n\nLet's solve it by equating to find total walking time in minutes.\n\nThe final answer should be a straightforward calculation from the given information. Let’s compute:\n\nSince \\( t_m \\):\nTotal walking:\n\\[ T_{total} = 34miles * (time per mile)\n= (60 + 19t/60) \n\\]\n\nLet's assume it to get total time in minutes.\nFinal answer: Answer is 120.",

The time spent walking is proportional to distance and speed, so we can set up ratios for both parts:\n   - For the beach: \\( v = \\frac{11}{t_{beach}} = \\frac{11}{\\frac{44}{60}} \\) (since 44 minutes converted into hours gives us a total of 29 miles).\n     Solving this, we get:\n       - \\( t_{beach} = \\frac{44}{60} * 11 = \\frac{508}{60}\\)\n   - For the sidewalk: Since speed on the sidewalk is twice that on the beach (\\(2v\\)), time spent walking at this faster pace will be:\n       \\( t_{sidewalk} = v / (2v) = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{(2*speed)} = \\frac{18}{60}\\)\n     Simplifying, we get: \n       - \\(t_{sidewalk} = 3 minutes\\)\n\nNow let's calculate the total time spent walking on both parts of her trail:\n- Total distance walked is indeed 29 miles.\n- Time for beach walk (44 mins) + Time for sidewalk walk (3 mins).\n\nThe final answer: The entire 29-mile walk takes Kimia \\( 47 \\) minutes.",

The problem states that she spends 60 minutes walking on the beach out of her entire walk time.\n3.

This means if it takes \\( t \\) minutes for her to walk one mile on the beach, then it will take \\( \\frac{t}{2} = 0.5t \\) minutes per mile on the sidewalk.\n4. Since Mei walks at a rate of speed such that she covers all the miles in total (28), we can calculate how many miles are walked on each segment:\n   - Let's assume it takes her \\( t \\) minutes to walk one mile on the beach, then 60 minutes for the beach part.\n5. Since there is no explicit time given or rate mentioned specifically about sidewalk walking, let’s denote the total distance as a fraction of miles covered in different segments (beach and sidewalk), based on speed ratio:\n   - Beach: \\( \\frac{15}{t} = 60/t \\) so she walks for 2 hours (or 120 minutes) to cover the beach part.\n6.

Leilani is sure to get 40% of the geometry questions right:\n   - 40% of 20: \n     \\( \\frac{40}{100} \\times 20 = 8 \\).\n\n5. She gets 1/10 (or 10%) correctly from both history and algebra.\n   - From 10 history questions, she is sure to get:\n     \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\times 10 = 1 \\).\n   \n   - For the 10 algebra questions,\n     similarly: \n      \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\times 10 = 1 \\).\n\n6. Adding up all her guaranteed correct answers:\n   - Geometry: 8\n   - History (guaranteed): 1\n   - Algebra (guaranteed): 1\n   \n7. Therefore, the total number of points she is sure to get from this quiz is \n   \\( 8 + 1 + 1 = 10 \\).\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 10",

      "raw": "\nStep by step reasoning:\n1. First, let's calculate the total hours Oscar watched TV on Saturday and Sunday.\n   - Each night he watches a 3-hour episode: \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\) hours.\n\n2. Next, we'll consider Monday where he watched an unknown number of episodes (x) each for 15 minutes which is equivalent to one hour per episode:\n   - Total time on Monday: \\(4\\text{ hours}\\).\n\n3. Then, let's look at Tuesday when he watches a full 6-hour episode and another show that was 0.75 hours long.\n   - Total time on Tuesday: \\[6 + 0.75 = 6.75\\) hours.\n\n4. Finally, we'll consider Wednesday where he watched four episodes each of which are 4 hours long:\n   - Total time on Wednesday: \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) hours.\n\nNow let's add all the known times together and subtract from the total to find out how many hours were spent watching TV only for Monday.\n- Known totals so far: \n  - Saturday & Sunday: 6 hours\n  - Tuesday: 6.75 hours\n  - Wednesday: 16 hours\n\n\\[ \\text{Total observed time} = 6 + 6.75 + 16\\]\n\nStep to calculate remaining TV watching on Monday:\n- Total watched in all days: \\(29\\) hours.\n- Known total so far including Monday's unknown episode count (x):\n\\[ 6 + 6.75 + x \\times 4 = 29 - (\\text{unknown time for Tuesday and Wednesday})\n\n\\]\nTherefore,\n\\[ 6 + 6.75 + x \\cdot 1 = 29 - 6.75\n- So, \\(x \\times 4 + 13.75 = 29\\) \n- Solving for x: \\(x \\approx (29 - 13.75) / 4\\)\n\n\\[x ≈ (15.25)/4 \\]\n\\[x ≈ 3.8125\n\nSince the number of episodes must be a whole number, we round it to the nearest whole number.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is \\(4\\)",

Calculate how many unoccupied beds there are: Subtracting the number of occupied beds from the total capacity gives us 1500 - 410 = 1090 unoccupied beds.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 1090",

Next, we need to find out how much more money is needed after accounting for what the community center has contributed. The remaining amount required from Carlos can be calculated by subtracting the contribution of the community center from the total cost: \\( 720 - 90 = 630 \\).\n4. Finally, since we know that Carlos currently only has €125 and needs at least €630 to cover his share for the tournament, he is missing this difference.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 630",

Given that the lasagna has 27 servings and both eat at this rate (Carlos consuming 3 servings/day and Nia consuming 8 times his amount), we can calculate how many days the lasagna will last by dividing the total number of servings in the lasagna by their combined daily consumption:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of Days} = \\frac{\\text{Total Servings}}{\\text{Combined Daily Consumption}} = \\frac{27}{27}\n   \\]\n\n4. Therefore, they will finish eating all 27 servings in exactly 1 day.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 1",

First, calculate the total time required to clean all 90 floors.\n   - Time per floor: 30 minutes = \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) hour.\n   - Total time for cleaning: \\( 90 \\text{ floors} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ hours/floor} = 45 \\text{ hours} \\).\n\n2. Calculate the total number of working hours available in 9 days, given they work 10 hours each day.\n   - Total working hours: \\( 9 \\text{ days} \\times 10 \\text{ hours/day} = 90 \\text{ hours} \\).\n\n3. Determine how many floors can be cleaned per hour based on the available total time and clean times:\n   - Floors per hour: \\( \\frac{45 \\text{ hours}}{10 \\text{ hours/day}} = 4.5 \\text{ floors/hour} \\) (since they work for a maximum of 9 days but only use up to their daily working limit).\n\n4. Calculate the total time spent cleaning:\n   - Time spent per floor: \\( \\frac{3}{20} \\text{ hours/floor} = 15 minutes.\n   - Total floors cleaned in 90 hours (available) at a rate of 4.5 floors/hour is indeed all 90 floors.\n\n5. Calculate the percentage of their day spent cleaning:\n   - Since they work for exactly 9 days, each working hour counts as part of this total time.\n   - Time spent per floor: \\( \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \\text{ hours/floor}.\n   - Total floors cleaned in a full cycle (considering daily limit): \\( \\frac{45 \\text{ hours}}{\\left(\\frac{90 \\text{ hours/day}}{10}\\right)} = 5 \\text{ days} \\).\n   - Time spent per day: \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\times 9 \\) floors.\n   - Total time cleaned in a full cycle of work (considering daily limit): \\( 4.5 \\text{ hours/day}.\n   - Percentage of their day spent cleaning:\n     - Floors cleaned each day = 10 * (\\( \\frac{3}{2} \\times 9/4.5) \\).\n     - This simplifies to: \\( 10 \\text{ floors/day}/(\\left(\\frac{90 \\text{ hours}}{10}\\right)} \\).\n\n6. Simplify the calculation for percentage:\n   - Floors cleaned per day = 27.\n   - Total work days in terms of their working limit (hours) is: \\( 45/3 + 3+ etc...).\n   - Percentage spent cleaning each hour/day on average.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be based directly from these calculations and simplifications. The percentage calculation yields:\n\nAnswer: The final answer is **20%**",

Convert cleaning time for one floor into a fraction of an hour (since work is in hourly units): \\( \\frac{30}{60} = 0.5\\ ) hour per floor.\n3.

Determine how many days it will take to clean all 120 floors: If the cleaner cleans 30 floors per day for a total of 120 floors, that would require \\( 120 / 30 = 4 \\) days.\n5. Since we are told they have only 10 days and need 4 to clean all the floors, it's clear there is an inconsistency in the problem statement (the cleaner can't work more than their allocated time).\n6. Assuming the question intends for them to use all available resources within those constraints:\n7. Calculate how much of each day they spend cleaning: Since they have only a 4-day window but need 10 days, it means we'll calculate based on average spending.\n8. The cleaner works at an efficient rate (30 floors in one workday) for the entire time given and needs to clean all floors within these constraints.\n9. For each day of cleaning: Since they can only complete their task within a 4-day window, divide that by the total number of days available: \\( \\frac{120}{\\text{Total Floors}} / \\text{Number of Days} = (30/6) * (\\frac{10-4}{4}) \\).\n10.
