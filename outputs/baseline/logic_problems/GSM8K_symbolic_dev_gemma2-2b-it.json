This represents the sum of all possible combinations within this ratio (105:21). We can use a variable to represent the unknown value, let's say 'x'.\n3. **Set up an equation:**  The total amount of sugar used corresponds to 105 parts in the ratio. Let's denote that Gabrielle uses x cups of water and then set up an equation: (x * 21) / 105 = 126 teaspoons. This represents how many parts are represented by the number of cups she used for every part of sugar she uses.\n4. **Solve for 'x':** Simplifying the equation, we get x/5 = 126 teaspoons.

Therefore, she walks at a rate of 28 miles / (4 minutes * 13 miles) = 0.57 miles per minute.\n3. **Calculate total time:**  To calculate her overall walking time, we need to know how long it takes for her to walk each part of the trail: \n\n   * Beach Walking Time: 60/2 = 30 minutes\n   * Sidewalk Walking Time: (28 miles / 57 min) * 13 miles \n\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 149.",

Then we can write the equation: Mei's score = x + 14\n2. **Set up an equation:**  We know that Mei scored one-half of Roya's points plus 14:  Mei's score = (1/2) * Roya's Score + 14\n3. **Solve for 'x':** Substitute the value of Roya's points, we have: Mei's score = (1/2) * 324 + 14.

This means she spends 8 hours / 2 = 4 hours walking, and 8 hours / 2 = 4 hours running.\n4. **Total Distance Covered:** To find her total distance covered we need to consider both running and skipping distances.\n\n**Calculating Running Distance:**  She runs for 4 hours at a speed of (2w). The distance she covers while running is 4 * 2w = 8w miles.\n\n**Calculating Skipping Distance:** She skips for 4 hours at a rate of (4/5)w. The distance covered during skipping is 4 * (4/5)w = (16/5) w miles.\n\n\nNow, to find the total distance she covers:\n* Total Distance = Running distance + Skipping distance\n\nTotal Distance = 8w + (16/5)w  = 32/5 w miles\n\n\n**Calculating Walking Time and Distance:** She walks for 4 hours at a speed of 'w'. The distance covered while walking is 4 * w miles.\n\n\n\n\nNow, we know she covers total distance in 8 hours:\n* Total Distance = (Running distance + Skipping distance)\n\nTotal Distance = (32/5) * w  + 4 * w\n\n\nTo get the final answer, substitute 'w' with its value from our earlier calculations to find the exact distance.\n\n\n\nAnswer: The final answer is **The problem has a typo and cannot be solved.**",

This can be written as: x + 6 = 3x. This simplifies to solve for 'x', which we know from step one, but then need to apply it to our problem\n4. **Calculate warm water swimming time:** To find the exact amount of extra time she takes when the water is warmer, you would subtract her cold-water swim time from her warm-water swim time in minutes and solve for 'x'. 6 = 3 * x  This can be used to simplify our equation\n5. **Find difference in times:** We know that Nia swims six miles on a hot day but we need to find the extra time it takes her to do so. This is where you'd use your calculated values from step three and four\n\n\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 180",
