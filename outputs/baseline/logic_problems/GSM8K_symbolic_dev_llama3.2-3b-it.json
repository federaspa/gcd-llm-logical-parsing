However, given that we're covering a distance directly across (from seafront to the other side), there will only be one 48-mile wide coverage area for the entire length of the city.\n\nStep 1: We've already been provided with this information in the problem - it takes 458 minutes to cover every 48 miles. This is essentially our rate per mile, but since we're looking at a distance that's equal to our given unit (48 miles), no further calculation for 'per mile' time is required.\n\nStep 2: Because there are multiple lengths of these sections in the city and this problem asks us about covering \"the whole\" city rather than some subset or portion, it seems we need more clarification but as written, this implies all distances must be covered at once. However since the given width matches our distance unit exactly (48 miles), let's calculate how many such 48-mile lengths there are across this entire span and then apply that to the provided time.\n\nStep 3: Given the total length of city from oceanfront to opposite inland edge is indeed just a single coverage area, we must think about whether or not our 'one' section interpretation fits with what's expected - but since every point in question does indeed fit within this one wide span and no other distances are provided for comparison against it (like 16 miles which would also be part of the whole city), using just given data seems most reasonable here.

Let's start by identifying the given information:\n   - Total number of students: 162\n   - Number of students who like to dance: 14\n   - Number of students who like to play basketball: 42\n   \n2. The problem states that there are only two remaining hobbies for the rest of the students, which are hiking and playing music.\n3. We also know that the number of students who prefer playing music is twice the number that prefers playing basketball.\n\nLet's denote the number of students who like to hike as H. Since the total number of students is 162 and we already have information about dance (14) and basketball (42), the remaining students must be hiking, music or both:\n   - Total = Dance + Basketball + Music\n4. We can express this equation with variables: \n   162 = 14 + 42 + M\n5. Where 'M' represents the number of students who prefer playing music.\n6. The problem states that the number of students preferring to play music is twice as many as those preferring basketball:\n   - Music (M) = 2 * Basketball (B)\n7. Substituting B with its given value and solving for M gives us: \n8. M = 42*2\n9.    M=84 \n\nNow let's calculate the number of students who prefer hiking.\n10. Total Students = Hiking + Music + Both\n11. Since we know that 'Music' is equal to twice basketball, it means some may be both (hiker and musician), which would change our calculation if we didn't have information about other options:\n   - We can simplify equation 7 by replacing the number of students who prefer music with its equivalent in terms of those preferring basketball.\n12. This will give us: \n    H + B = Total\n13. Since M=2B, and from step 8 we know that 'M' equals to 84:\n14. Therefore it means B also is equal to 42 (given) but multiplied by two as per our condition for music.\n15. We have already calculated this in steps above: \n   - Music = Total number of basketball players *2\n16. In the context of solving equation H+B+M=162 from step 10, where we now know that B and M are equivalent to:\n17.   Basketball +  Music i.e., (B=M) since they both equal twice their respective counts for 'Basketball'.\n18. Our final calculation will thus simplify down as follows: \n    Total = Hiking + Twice the number of basketball players\n19. Substitute known values into this formula.\n20. We already know:\n   - Basketball is 42\n21. Since M equals to B times two we substitute that too which was equal to (42 *2)\n22. Now, our equation simplifies down further as follows: \n    Total = Hiking + Twice the number of basketball players becomes \n       162=H+42*2\n23. Substitute twice Basketball into this formula.\n24. It is now time for final calculation:\n   - We calculate 'M', which will be equal to 84 (from step 8), but we are looking at it from a different perspective, the basketball players being equivalent of both M and B =42*2=84\n25. From steps above: H+Music=Music+B i.e., \n    Total=162 becomes  \n       -H +Basketball *2=Basketball+ Music (i.e., 2 times Basketball)\n26. Solving for 'B' we see that, M=84 which is B*2.\n27. We know the basketball players are twice as many students who like to play music\n28. In this case both values of these groups will be equal since they're being multiplied by two in one equation (M=B * 2)\n29. As calculated before:\n   - M=84 and \n30. B also =42 \n\nNow substitute the known value into our final formula: H + Music – Both.\n31. Now, given that total number of students is 162\n32. Total Students equals to Hiking (H)+Basketball *2 i.e., Basketball+Music:\n   - As we now know both basketball and music are equivalent to 42*2=84\n33. To find the value for 'hiking' which represents all remaining hobbies, let's use algebra.\n34. If total students equals hiking + twice number of basketball players \n35. H = Total – (Basketball *2)\n36. Using known values:\n   - Basketball is 42 and Twice it will be: \n37. Therefore our equation becomes\n    h=162-(B*2)\n\nNow using the value we know for B i.e., B equals to 84 divided by two since they are multiplied together, (84/2)\n38. Then H = Total – Number of Basketball players * Two which gives us:\n39.",

We know that the number of students who prefer painting or baking is equal to the total number of students minus those who have other hobbies.\n3.

According to the problem, 'the number that like to bake is twice the number that prefer playing hurling.'\n   - Since there are 11 students who play hurling and each of them would be counted in baking as well (as we have calculated total for paint+bake=32), this implies:\n      a = Students painting + Students baking\n      b = Students playing hurling\n\n6.

The number of students who like to dance is given as 74, and we need to find out how many like to read or paint combined.\n3. Let's denote the number of students who prefer painting as P and those who want to play badminton as B. We are told that P = 2B (the number of students who like to paint is twice the number that prefers playing badminton).\n4. Since there are only three categories: dance, badminton, and either read or paint, we can calculate the total number of students in these first two categories as B + 74.\n5. We know from step 3 that P = 2B, so if we replace P with its value (from step 1), it becomes 2B = 2 * 6 = 12 because there are 6 students who prefer playing badminton.\n6. Now we can find out how many like to paint: B + 74 is the total number of dance and badminton fans, which means that (B= 12) plus those who read will add up with a remainder of zero as they are all accounted for in the 'rest' category, leaving us only needing to subtract from our initial count.\n7.

Then in the next 24 seconds (total of 48 seconds), he popped 4 times that amount: \n   - Initial popping rate per second is 80 / 24 = 3.333 pop/second\n   - 4 * 3.333 = 13.33, rounded to a whole number as kernels can't be fractional for this problem (so we round down to the nearest integer), which equals approximately 13 pop in that period.\n   \n   Total popped after second interval is: \n   Initial pops + Pops from next 24 seconds = 80 + 13 = 93.\n\n3. In the third interval of 48 seconds, Mateo's popping rate increases by six times compared to previous intervals (the initial amount was already included in step 2): \n   - The new pop per second is: Initial pops/second * 6\n   - Popped kernels for this period would be: New pop rate / Total time = ((80+13) /24)*48*6.\n\n4. First, calculate the actual \"popper\" value in step3:\n- Calculate initial amount of popped kernels per second after adding them up to get (80 + 13): \n   - The result is (93)\n   \n- Multiply it by 6 and divide by 1/2 for total time taken: ((93) * 48)/24*6 = 186.\n  \n5. Now calculate the final popped kernels:\n   New rate pop per second after rounding up to nearest integer, that is approximately equal to the amount popped in step3.\n\n- Since it increased six times compared to previous periods (round down), we round this value back as well: ((93 *6))\n  - The result of above calculation gives us an initial rounded-up number.\n \n   Now divide by total time taken i.e., 24 seconds, multiply the whole thing with new rate pop per second and then again calculate it for one more interval.\n\n- Calculate popped kernels from final period:\n  We round down to nearest integer: ((186))\n  \n - Multiply this value *6 (for increased popping) /24 \n   gives us a number of approximately 29.5, which is rounded up as well\n   i.e., result after calculation will be used in subsequent interval.\n\n- Final popped kernels from last period:\n   Now multiply the initial popped amount by rate per second for this new interval: (186*6)/1/2.\n   \n    This gives us a final number of approximately 561, which we round down to nearest integer as well. \n\n6.

Total number of popcorn pieces Mateo has to eat is the sum of all popped kernels minus those that didn't pop from residual heat:\n   - Add initial 80, total amount for first two periods: \n       (93) + ((186))\n        i.e., result of above calculation will be used in subsequent steps.\n   \n   Then add this with final popped after rounding up to nearest integer.\n\nStep by step reasoning is complete. Now we move on to the answer part.\n\n\nAnswer:\nNow calculate all values for each interval from previous step:\n\nInitial popping rate per second: \n- (80 / 24) = 3.333\nNew popping amount every period of 48 seconds after that first initial round:\n   - Initial popped in second period is given as approximately 13 pop.\n   \nFinal popped kernels:\n- Calculate the actual \"popper\" value for this interval: ((93)*6)/2 \n i.e., (561) rounded up.\n\nResidual heat pops from last 24 seconds\ni.e., A quarter of that number will be used to calculate final answer.\n\nNow sum all values calculated in previous steps:\n\nStep1 and Step 2:\nTotal popped after first two periods is: 93 + ((186))\n   i.e result equals (279).\n\nFinal Popped Amount After Adding Last Interval \n- The amount from last interval for the calculation above will be rounded up to nearest integer as well.\n\nNow calculate residual heat pops\ni.e., A quarter of those that popped in final period.\nWe already calculated total popped kernels during previous step so now we can use it:\n   - Calculate a quarter of these: (561) * 1/4\n\nTotal Popped After Including Residual Heat \n- Add initial amount, and all the other amounts for each interval.\n\nNow calculate this value to get final result:\n\nStep by Step Calculation is Complete.

Since the ratio of sugar to water is 80:70, we can represent the amount of water as (60/80)x = (3/4)x.\n\nWe are given that x + (3/4)x = 600. \n\nTo solve this equation, let's combine like terms:\n\n(7/4)x = 600\n\nNow multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:\n7x = 2400\nDivide both sides by 7 to isolate 'x':\nx = 2400 / 7 \nx ≈ 342.857 \n\nSince we can't use a decimal in this context, and considering that our initial assumption was based on ratios with fractional numbers, rounding is not the right answer here but for practical purposes Elena used approximately 343 teaspoons of sugar.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 343.",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. We are given the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water as 105:21.\n2. To simplify this problem, we can find a common multiple for both parts of the ratio and then scale it up to fit Gabrielle's total amount used (126).\n3. However, in this case, since one part is already a factor of the other, we don't need to do that step.\n4. We are given 105 teaspoons of sugar out of every 21 cups of water for some multiple of those amounts being used by Gabrielle with a total sum equaling 126 units (sugar + water).\n5. The ratio is equivalent to 1 cup of water per (21/105) = 0.2 or 1/5 teaspoonful sugar.\n6. We know that the number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water add up to 126 total parts, so let's represent this as: x + y = 126\n7. Since we also have a ratio in terms of 'x' (the amount used for each unit), our original equation becomes:\n   - The part representing teaspoons is now 21/105*x \n    But that can be reduced by factoring out the lowest common multiple between numerator and denominator which equals to \"21\" : so it reduces down as follows\n      - The parts represent teaspoons: (1 * x) = (5x)/21 units for sugar since ratio was provided in terms of 5. This gives us:\n         - Now we have equation set up with one unknown variable.\n8. Plug this value into the first part of our total unit equation to solve it, \n   - The second term is: y = (126) - x\n    In order for you and i both get the final answer on 5/21 units as ratio was given in terms of \"1 cup\" that represents a certain amount so we need this value too.\n9. Plug our calculated values into these variables, \n   -(a) We will plug (x + y = 126), then:\n       x: The number representing the total for teaspoons is equal to : [5 * 21/105] units of sugar in cup terms or just \"1\" times something so that would be\n            - Let's solve this equation, first \n      -(b) If we plug into second variable and set it up with variables 'x' & 'y'\n        y = (126/x)\n\n10. After plugging both values for x into our ratio to find the answer, since there is only one unknown value left in 2 equations: \"1\" times something equals total units of sugar used by Gabrielle so that would be\n    -(a) First plug variable 'x' from equation (5 * 21/105)x = number of teaspoons \n     - Let's get x first then, divide both sides by the constant we multiplied to it on left side and factor out common denominator if any.\n        After solving for \"1\" times something that would be value of one unit. To find total amount used for sugar units: multiply our calculated result with some multiple from equation above so now \n          - 5x/21 * (126/x) = number of teaspoons\n    -(b) Multiply both sides by the constant factor to isolate \"number of teaspoon\" then, do math in parentheses first.\n        After this you get your final answer as: \n\nStep by step reasoning is done.\n\nAnswer:\nTo find total amount used for sugar units we multiply our calculated result with some multiple from equation above. \nAfter doing all calculations and plugging variable 'x' into equations to solve it then, divide both sides of the expression \"5 * 21/105*x\" by x (the unknown) if you don't have a constant factor on left side or just get rid of that denominator after multiplying with another number which was equaling some multiple from above.

Since the amount of sugar and water are in ratio, let's assume that x represents the multiplier for both sugar and water. Therefore, the actual amounts can be represented as:\n\n- Sugar: 128x\n- Water: 20x\n\nThe sum of these parts is equal to the total number of teaspoons used (1332).

So the total number of harvests per year is:\n    Harvests per year = Number of months * Harvest frequency\n                    = 12 * 1 \n                    (Since we want how many bananas can be harvested at least once within the whole year, hence, one time)\n5. Now let's calculate the total number of bananas he can harvest in a year.\n   Total bananas harvested in a year = Total bananas - 0 \n    Since there is no leftover banana and it will get consumed each two months\n6. So,\n   Answer: The final answer is 1000",

Next, we'll find out how much cucumbers weigh in total: 13 bags * 6 kg/bag = 78 kg.\n\n3. Now, let's determine the amount of apples bought: 31 packs * 42 kg/pack = 1294 kg.\n\n4. Then, calculate the weight of wheats purchased: 15 sacks * 15 kg/sack = 225 kg.\n\n5. To find out how much feed in total is needed to be transported, we need to add up all these weights together: oats (15 kg) + cucumbers (78 kg) + apples (1294 kg) + wheats (225 kg).\n\n   Total weight of feed = 15 + 78 + 1294 + 225 = 1612 kg.\n\n6. Lastly, let's figure out how many trips the farmer needs by dividing the total weight of all the feeds combined with his farm truck capacity: \n   \n    Number of trips needed = Total weight / Truck capacity\n   \n   Since he can't make a fraction of a trip (we have to round up if we get any remainder), and considering that 1612 is not divisible evenly into 180, let's find out by dividing.\n   \n   Trip number calculation:\n   \n      Trips made so far with full truck = 9 * 180 kgs\n   \n      The remaining weight after these trips would be: \n      \n        Total - (Trips Made) x Truck Capacity\n      \n         In this case, the total is 1612. So we need to calculate how many times our capacity of 180 can fit into 1612 without going over.\n   \n   Dividing:\n   \n    Trips made so far with full truck = 9 * 180 kgs\n   \n     First trip:  0 - (1 x 180) \n      Result for the first Trip: Total weight > Truck Capacity\n     \n        Second trip:  0 + ((1612 / 180))\n  \n   Number of trips calculation:\n   \n    The second trip would be the one that gets him over, since he has to carry all his feed. So we need two full truck capacity loads and a final load less than our 180 kg truck.\n\n     Final Trip: Since it is impossible for this last step to fit completely within an answer box format let me give you how much trips there would be:\n   \n   Total number of trips = Trips Made so far with full truck + Additional trip needed\n   \n      We know the first two trips will have a total weight less than 360, as we can figure by dividing 1612 and using our knowledge that he bought fifteen sacks or more.\n\n     Since his final sack is over the remaining capacity to reach 180 kg after two complete loads. The number of additional trips needed (in addition to those full truck capacity) would be one since you cannot have a fraction in real life when it comes to these things and we know by calculating that there will not only need at least three but more than just three.\n\nStep by step calculation:\n   \n   Total weight = 1612 kg\n   \n   Dividing this number with the 180 kg capacity gives us: \n     \n     Number of full truck loads (including any additional needed) is found by dividing and taking a whole, as we must have at least that many but possibly more than three trips since his last load will be less. So for example if he only had 900kg left after the first two complete loads:\n   \n   For this let's say: Number of full truck capacity used in those initial full loads = (2 * Truck Capacity)\n   \n     Second, we know that our second trip is going to need just one sack more than a multiple of his maximum weight since it can't be completely full.\n     \n         In other words 1612 divided by 180 gives us the following:\n       \n           Trips made so far with full truck = (9 * 180)\n   \n   So if he only had 900kg left after two complete loads, we'd know that our final trip will have to include just enough feed for another one more sack.\n   \n     In this case: \n     \n         Number of trips = First Two Full Truck Capacity Loads + Additional Trip Needed\n    \n        For the last load since it is going over by less than 180 kg in capacity, let's say we want a number that would give us an answer within our text format. We could get close to or at this amount using two full truck loads and one final trip.\n   \n   Number of trips = (2 * Truck Capacity) + 1\n\nStep by step calculation:\n   \n     First Two Full Truck Capacity Loads: \n     \n      Since each load is a complete capacity, we multiply our total truck capacity for these initial three or more.

    "logic_problem": {
      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's calculate the total weight of wheats: 8 boxes * 3 kg/box = 24 kg.\n2. Next, we'll find the total weight of carrots: 14 bags * 6 kg/bag = 84 kg.\n3. Then, calculate the total weight of apples: 35 packs * 38 kg/pack = 1330 kg.\n4. Now, let's determine the total weight of hay: 17 sacks * 16 kg/sack = 272 kg.\n\n5. The farmer has a truck that can carry 190 kgs at a time, so we need to find out how many trips are needed for each type of feed separately:\n   - For wheats: Total weight / Truck capacity = 24 kg / 190 kg ≈ 0.1263 or roughly 1 trip.\n   - For carrots: Since the farmer only needs enough carrots while they're fresh, we'll assume he buys them all at once and transport them in separate trips from other feed. \n     However, since this is not specified as a condition for the calculation of total trips required (only wheats being transported separately), let's ignore it for now.\n   - For apples: 1330 kg / 190 kg ≈ 7 trips\n   - For hay: Total weight / Truck capacity = 272 kg / 190 kg ≈ 1.433 or roughly 2 trips.\n\n6. Since the farmer has to transport all types of feed together, we'll consider each type separately and sum up their required trips:\n   - Wheats: 1 trip\n   - Carrots (for now): ignoring separate trips for carrots in calculation.\n   - Apples: approximately 7 trips\n   - Hay: approximately 2 trips\n\nStep by step total trips = Trips for wheats + Trips for hay + Trips for apples \n                          ≈ 1(1) + 2(2) + (integer part of trip count from division, because a partial truck load doesn't constitute another full trip)\n                          Since the farmer needs to make one more round with some remaining feed that isn't counted here: \n                           So Step by step total trips = Trips for wheats + Trips for hay + Trips for apples\n ≈ 1(3) + (integer part of trip count from division, because a partial truck load doesn't constitute another full trip)\n Since the farmer needs to make one more round with some remaining feed that isn't counted here: \n So Step by step total trips = 3 + 2 =5+ integer remainder\n\n7. For carrots (as they are only bought in bulk for their freshness, and there's no need for multiple separate transports of these), let us find out how much weight is left after the previous transport.\n   Total weight transported so far: wheats(24 kg) + hay(272kg)= 296 kgs\n   Remaining carrots to be carried = (Total carrots bought - remaining amount that will stay on-farm): \n     The only information given about their staying power is 'enough while they're fresh' which would mean, there isn't much of an excess supply. We'll assume most or all the 84 kg was consumed as part of a separate transport from other feeds.\n   Remaining weight for carrots in current trip: = Carrots left / Truck capacity\n     Since we've assumed that it's mostly consumed during previous transports and only bought once, \n       The remaining amount is not specified. However if you were to assume the 'fresh' condition means at least half of all 84 kg was eaten after buying:\n          Remaining carrots in current trip = (0.5 * Carrots) / Truck capacity\n         So for simplicity let's use a different assumption about how much they are used and say that it is approximately equal or very close to the amount calculated before transport.\n   Since most of the carrots were consumed during previous transports, we can assume 84kg was also bought at one time with other feed (alongside apples). In our calculation above for total trips required, this remaining weight isn't included. This should not be an issue here because it is still part of a bulk order and in any case would likely have been transported during another trip which doesn't affect the number of trips to transport wheats or hay.\n\n8. Since we are only interested in calculating how many total trips he needs for all types, let's use our simplified assumption that remaining carrots were bought with other feed.\n9. Total weight carried so far = Wheats + Hay + Carrots \n                            ≈ 296 kgs\n10. Now calculate the total number of additional trips needed to carry out these feeds:\n   Additional weights left after previous transport: (Remaining carrots) / Truck capacity \n\nSince there are two remaining factors, and we've determined how many trips will be required for other feed types already above - let's combine them here.\n\nStep by step reasoning was completed.

But he has more than that, let's try dividing the available bananas by baskets with remainder as well.\n\n337 ÷ 8 is not a whole number but we know it will go into some of the baskets completely:\nBananas Placed Completely = floor(42) \nBananas Placed in Remaining Baskets = 29 * (8 - floor(42))\n= 29 * 0\nSince all bananas fit perfectly with no remainder for those, let's re-evaluate by distributing it as evenly as possible.\nWe can calculate the total number of fully placed bananas:\nBananas Placed Completely ≈ 42\n\nThe remaining will be distributed among other baskets but since he only has more than his capacity and we have to account for every banana that fits in a basket or not:\n\n337 - (8 * 29) = 337 -232\nThis is incorrect as it suggests taking away from the total bananas available.\n\nHowever, considering each basket's limit of holding 29:\nWe see Luis can place more than what his baskets hold. We need to subtract only until he exhausts all banana capacity limits but we have already exceeded that number so now let's find how many are left over.\nBananas Not Placed = Total Bananas Available - (Total Baskets * Bananas per Basket)\nSince total bananas available exceed the basket limit, and no more can fit in baskets without exceeding their individual capacity:\nThe correct calculation then becomes simply removing as much of his banana supply from each basket's potential amount.\n\n337 ÷ 8 ≈ 42.375.\nSo we see how many are left after filling up all possible space on every single one: \nSince Luis only has a limited number, and it is more than what he can hold in the baskets:\nWe'll find out remaining by simply taking his total bananas minus that of capacity.\n\n337 ÷ 8 ≈ 42.375\n\nHowever since we cannot have fractions of a banana but rather whole ones for this calculation:\n\nBananas Not Placed = Total Bananas - (Total Baskets * Remaining after filling all baskets)\nWe'll multiply the number of full basket spaces by bananas per space, and then subtract that from his total to get how many will not fit:\nSince Luis's available exceeds capacity: \nLet us consider it another way for clarity.\n\nLuis has 337. Each can take a maximum of 29.\nHe cannot place more than he has in each individual basket so we must find the remainder after distribution is considered completely filled:\n\nBananas Placed Completely ≈ floor(42 * 8)\nBut since this calculation also exceeds his capacity, it shows there's been an error with initial approach for total banana placement.\n\nThe correct way to think about it would be simply how many bananas he has in excess of what the baskets can hold when full.

Next, calculate the number of potted plants given to friends and family by multiplying the number of windows (51) with the number of plants each will receive (6). \n   However, this is actually unnecessary since she's giving away a fixed amount from each window regardless of how many are left on that specific ledge.\n3.

Instead, determine the total number Yara gives away: \n    Multiply 51 by 6 to get how many she'll give:\n      However we already know that there are going to be fewer than 561 plants left when all the ledges have had some given away and so it is easier just subtracting a fixed amount from each window.\n5.

The question asked for how many will remain so instead of actually calculating each window Yara could subtract 51 times six as explained.\n   Subtracting a fixed amount per ledger (6) from every one is what's needed. \n   Total removed: 51 * 6 = 306\n6.

We know that it takes them 28 minutes to reach the library corner, but this is not directly relevant as they still have some distance left before reaching the actual location of the mall.\n3. However, we are given additional information about walking an extra time after visiting the cinema (library), which actually means our goal should be calculating how long it takes for them to walk from their current point at library corner until the mall, with no late penalty applied since they've just been there and can now move on.\n4. We're told that once Arash & Arjun reach this 'after-cinema' location (where cinema is actually closer than we initially think), it takes 12 minutes to get to the actual cinema itself from here which tells us how long their journey will take in total for them, however there's no need as our interest is solely about finding remaining time before they are late.\n5. So let’s recalculate: if Arash and Arjun have walked a distance of library corner - (cinema), that would be 12 minutes, but what we actually want to know is how long does it take for them get from the point where they can see mall to just reaching within those remaining time left.\n6. In other words since total journey has been completed once cinema reached & now there's nothing more stopping Arash and Arjun (as library corner was their 'last stop') - we're simply interested in finding out how long is required for them get from that last point, where they can see the mall to just getting within those remaining 93 minutes.\n7. However since this distance has already been covered once before cinema reached & now there's nothing left but walking towards actual location (mall), let’s find out total time taken so far by Arash and arjun for reaching library corner then visit it, then get to the point where they can see mall which would take them another 12 minutes from here after having completed their entire journey.\n8. Since we already know that this whole process took a certain amount of time & now there's nothing left but walking towards actual location (mall), let’s do simple arithmetic by subtracting time taken so far, i.e library corner - cinema visit which is equal to 28 minutes +12 from remaining available time:\n9.

So we can write this as: \nP_tuesday = P_wednesday - 19\nSince he sold 14 more boxes of muffins than on Tuesday and the number of box for muffin is given, then:\nM_wednesday = M_tuesday + 14\n\n- On Wednesday, Jamal sold:\n   - 24 boxes of pomegranate pie. \n   - He sold 19 fewer boxes of muffin compared to wednesday as per tuesday sales.\nSo we can write the following equations:  \nP_tuesday = P_wednesday\nM_tuesday +14= M_wednesday \n\nSince, M_tuesday is given which is equal to 24. \nThen using above equation:\nM_tuesday+14=M_wednesday\n24+14=M_wednesday\n38=M_wednesday\n\n- Now we can find P_tuesday and P_wednesday.\nGiven that: M_tuesday = 24, then from first two equations of tuesday sales data we get \nP_wednesday -19=P_tuesday\nSubstituting value for M_Tues:\n24+14=38 as calculated above. \n\nAnd the equation now becomes,\n24+14=M wednesay\nWe already know it to be 38 so lets find out P wednesday.\nNow, using two equations of tuesday sales data \nP_wednesday -19=P_tuesday\nSubstituting value for M_Tues:\n24 =P_tuesday\n\nSo equation now becomes,\n24= Pwednesday-19 \n\nAdd both sides by 19 and we get the pWednesay to be equal to (38+19)=57.\n\nNow that we have all values of boxes sold on tuesday and wednesday, let's calculate total sales for two days.\nTotal muffin box = M_Tues +M_Wed\n=24+38 \n= 62\n\nCost per box:\n- For each muffin: ¥8 \n- Cost per pomegranate pie: ¥28 \n\nNow Total sale can be calculated as follows:\nFor Muffins, total sales would equal to (number of boxes) x (cost/box).\nSo for muffin = 62 * 8\n= 496\n\nAnd for Pomegranate Pie:\nTotal number of box sold is \nPwednesday+ P_Tues\n57 +24\n80 \n\nCost per Box: ¥28.\nSo total sale would equal to (number of boxes) x(cost/box)\nSo, total sales = 80 * 28  \n= 2240\n\nFinally Total Earnings:\nFor muffin and pomegranate pie,\nTotal earnings for two days is sum of their individual sales.

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of muffin boxes and orange pie boxes sold on both days. \n\nOn Wednesday: \n- Muffins = 23\n- Orange Pies (boxes) = 23 - 18 (since he sold 18 fewer than Thursday)\n= 5\n\nHowever, this seems incorrect as we need to consider '13 more' in the context of muffin sales for a better understanding.\nConsidering it again:\nMuffins on Wednesday could have been 23 and orange pies could be calculated based on some other condition.\n\nLet's correct that - \n- Muffins = 23\n- Orange Pies (boxes) can't simply be reduced by '18'. It is mentioned as '13 more boxes of muffin than Thursday', so let us take Wednesday's number for oranges first. As orange pies were sold on Thursday, we need the difference between Thursday and today - which has not been stated.\n\nConsidering another way:\n- Let x represent Wednesday's orange pie sales.\nThen 24 will be represented by (x+13).\n\nHowever: \nIt can also mean that if he sold '18 fewer' boxes of oranges than Thursday's total. Then, Thursday’s orange pies must have actually more - we know this because Friday has lesser number.\n\nIf the problem states 'on Wednesday', then it might simply state how many less muffins were made on Thursday and in what comparison.\nAnother way:\n- Let x represent Wednesday's muffin sales (which is already given).\nThen 13 more boxes of muffins than Wednesday = x + 13\nBut we are trying to get the number for Wednesday, so let us first try this: \nx+13 = Total on Thursday’s - total on Wed.\n\nHowever that will not provide any value as it has left another term without an expression.\nAnother method:\nThursday's orange pies must have more boxes than Wednesday. Therefore, if we simply reduce '18', then he could sell fewer muffins and those can be 23. Let us try this instead:\n\n- Muffin sold on Thursday = x+13\nAnd Orange pie sold today (Wednesday) will equal: \n(x - 18)\n\nNow using the fact that Wednesday's orange pies must have a lesser number than yesterday:\nx-18=5\n\nAdding '18' to both sides, we get \nx=23.\n\nSubstituting this value back into x+13 equation for muffins on Thursday,\nMuffin sales = (x + 13) \n                = 23 + 13\n                = 36\n\nThus:\nOrange pies sold today: \n(x -18)\n             =(23-18)\n              =5 \n\nStep by step calculation of total earnings is as follows:\n\nOn Wednesday, Mohammed earned $10 * 23 boxes of muffins and $21 * (23 – 18) = $21*5= $105 in orange pie sales.\n\nThus: \nWednesday's Earnings = ($10 x 23 ) + ($21x(5))\n                    =$230+$105\n                   =$335\n\nOn Thursday, Mohammed earned $10 * 36 boxes of muffins and $21 * (24)=$504 for the pies. \n\nThursday’s earnings will be:\n($10*36)+$504 = $1440.\n\nTotal Earnings for Two Days: \n= Wednesday's Earnings + Thursday's Earnings\n              =$335+$1440  \n             =$1775\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 1775",

On Tuesday, he sold 25 boxes of cupcake.\n3. For watermelon pie, since it's 15 fewer than on Wednesday, let's denote the number of boxes of watermelon pie sold on Wednesday as 'x'. Then, we can represent the number of watermelon pie boxes sold on Tuesday as (x - 15).\n4. On Wednesday, he sold 14 more boxes of cupcakes than on Tuesday, which is (25 + 14) = 39.\n5. We already know that James sold 21 boxes of watermelon pies on Wednesday.\n6. Now we have the following system of equations:\n   Cupcakes: \n      x - 15 = 39\n   Watermelons:\n      x = 21\n\n7. To find out how many cupcakes were sold, let's solve 'x' from the equation above for both watermelon and cupcake.\n   Solving for 'x': Since we know that on Wednesday he sold 14 more boxes of cupcakes than Tuesday (25 + 14) and also in other words x = number of cupcakes sold on Wednesday. \n      So, let's solve it first to find the value of x\n         On Wednesday: x -15 =39 => x =39+15   :x=54.\n    For Watermelon Pie:\n        The equation was already solved for 'x' which is equal to 21.\n\n8.

We know that Mia spends 60 minutes walking on the beach, which is equivalent to 12 kilometers (the length of the portion walked on the beach).\n\n2. Let's assume her rate of speed while walking on the beach as 'b' km/hr.\n3. Since she walks at two times this rate when walking on the sidewalk, we can say that Mia's speed on the sidewalk is '2b' km/hr.\n\n4. We know that distance = speed * time. Given 60 minutes (or 1 hour) for her to walk 12 kilometers on the beach, and assuming she doesn't take a break during this period, we have:\n   b * t_b = 12\n   Where 't_b' is the time taken in hours.\n\n5. We also know that distance walked on sidewalks equals total sidewalk length (which includes both walking times), so for Mia's entire walk of 24 km with twice her beach speed,\n   \n    (2b) * t_s + b * t_b = 12 + 12\n   This simplifies to: \n       (2b)*t_s + bt_b = 24 \n\n6. Since we already know that 'bt_b' is equal to 60 minutes or 1 hour, let's substitute and rearrange the equation:\n    2*t_s + t_b - t_b = 23\n   Thus,\n    2 * (total walking time on sidewalks) equals remaining distance walked.\n   \n7. Since Mia spends a total of 't_total' hours to complete her entire walk,\n \n   The final step is then: since we know that she has spent an hour walking the beach, this can be written as:\n      t_s + 1 = t_total \n\nSince for every one minute (or one half-hour) added to sidewalk time will add twice a unit of distance. Thus,\n\nWe get\n2*(t_total - 1)*60 minutes equals remaining total distances walked on sidewalks after her first hour spent.\n\nTherefore,\n(24 km * 3/4 = 18 km).\nThus the formula then is \n   (2*t_s + t_b) which has to be equal with: \n\n      36 or 6 hours in this scenario for Mia's complete walk.",

We are given that Beatriz walks 18 miles of her favorite walking trail on the beach, which takes up t_minutes. Since we know she covers a distance at a constant speed (rate), we can write an equation: \n   rate * time = distance\n   For this case specifically for the sidewalk portion and also set it to equal its corresponding value.\n\n3. We're told that Beatriz walks 10 miles on the sidewalk, which takes up T_minutes - t_minutes. Since she does two times her speed of walking in the beach portion compared with the sidewalk: \n   (2 * rate) * time = distance\n\n4. From steps above we know for the walk part:\n    rate * time_beach = 18\n    And for sidewalks, this becomes:\n     (2*rate)*time_sidewalk=10 \n\n5. Since Beatriz walks at two times her speed of walking in sidewalk compared to beach portion: \n   then using algebra and replacing 'T_minutes' by a variable we will get t_beach = 54/18 =3\n    And also rate * (t_total - t_s) is equal to distance_sidewalk=10. The equation becomes:\n      rate*( T_total-t_b ) = 10\n    \n   Also knowing that the total duration of her walk in minutes, i.e., \n     We now know time for beach portion: \n        Then we plug this into above equations (rate * t_beach)=18\n            So the remaining will be a simple calculation:\n    rate*(T_total -t_s) = 10 \n\n      Since 'time' and hence also value of distance can only depend on rates, if that was true then when time is equal to zero total time too has to become zero.\n   Let's plug in t_b =3 minutes into the equation.\n\nStep by step we will try plugging it back:\n   18 * x - (54-18)=10\n   So rate*x=28+54 \n      Since distance covered on sidewalk portion is equal to speed times time spent walking there, since she walks twice as fast there than in beach. This means that if the total value of her walk for this part has been calculated then we will be able to get 'x'. To find x plug it into rate * (t_total - t_s) = 10 \n\n   Since distance_sidewalk is equal to speed times time spent walking on sidewalk, so: \n    We know that:\n      Then plugging value of T_minutes into above equation and we will be able to calculate the total duration of her walk in minutes.\n       If rate*3=18 then this means 2*(rate * t_s) =10. Now let's plug 't_b' back.\n\nStep by step, \n   So we know that if time spent walking on beach is equal to 54/18 and distance_sidewalk has been calculated above:\n      We will be able to determine total walk duration in minutes since rate*3=18 then calculate t_s\n\n\nStep by step plugging this value back into equation: \n\n       Then plug 'x' (which we know the value of now) back \n    Since time spent walking on sidewalk is 2*(rate * x)=10\n\n        And finally let's try to determine total duration\n   rate*3=18 then calculate t_s\n\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n...\nSo if distance_sidewalk has been calculated as above, we can solve for the value of 'T_minutes'. Since time spent walking on beach is 54/18 minutes and distance_sidewalk will be equal to speed times time spent walking there: \n   We plug it back into equation rate*( T_total - t_s )=10\n      And since total duration in this case has been calculated, so we can calculate the final value for 'T_minutes' by using values of x that was determined above.\n\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n...\nNow let's determine what is 'rate'. \n   We know distance_sidewalk = 10 then time spent walking there must be t_s.

We are given that Amelia walks 11 kilometers on the beach, so we can write an equation: 11 = r_b * t_b\n3. Since she spends 44 minutes (or 44/60 hours) walking on the beach, we have another equation: t_b = 44 / 60.\n4. Now we need to find her rate of speed on the sidewalk. We are given that it's two times faster than the beach walk. So r_s = 2 * r_b\n5. Amelia walks a total distance of 24 kilometers, consisting of 11 km on the beach and 13 km on the sidewalk. Therefore we can write another equation: t_s + t_b = 24/60 hours where t_s is time spent walking on the sidewalk.\n6. We know that her speed ratio between sidewalk and beach are r_s:r_b = (2*r_b) :r_b which simplifies to 3:1 or in terms of distance covered, she will take three times as much time for each km walked on the side walk compared to her time taken walking on a kilometer of beach. So we can express this relationship between sidewalk and beach distances using ratio 11 * t_s = (13) *t_b\n7. Now let's substitute values from step 2, into equation in Step 6: \n   We have value for t_b as well as its relation to time spent walking on the side walk - we will be able express everything through one variable 't'.\n8. Substituting for both values of times (beach and sidewalk) with calculated expression from step 4, we get:\n     *   Since we are working in hours let's make sure our unit consistent \n       i.e., using same units while solving equation\n    => We need to multiply by the conversion factor which is 60 minutes per hour. Hence value of t_b = (44/60) h and  time taken walking on sidewalk will be as follows:   *t_s=24h-(11*60 /13)\n      This also holds true from step4 - where total distance walked divided into two parts \n       which are beach walk & side-walks.\n9. Now let's substitute t_b = (44/60) h  in the above equation to find value of 't_s' :   *time taken walking on sidewalk is calculated as follows: \n     => t_s=(24 -11*(44/13*60))= hours\n10. Given that speed ratio between sidewalks and beaches are r_s:r_b = (2*r_b) :r_b which simplifies to 3:1, or in terms of time taken for each km walked on the sidewalk compared to her time taken walking a kilometer on beach - she takes three times as much time.\n    So if we take value calculated from equation t_b above and multiply by 3 then it will give us value of 't_s' that is required here. \n11. Thus, for every km walked on the side-walks taking this relation into account:\n   *value of t_s= (24-(11*(44/13*60)))h\n     which holds true from above calculations.\n12. Now let's substitute value calculated in step 9 and multiply by 3 to get our final answer - since we know that for every km walked on the side-walks she takes three times as much time:\n    *value of t_s= (24-(11*(44/13*60)))h \n      We now calculate this.\n   => value of t_b = 0.7333 h\n     So, substituting into our equation:  \n       *t_s=(24 -1.2)\n        which holds true from above calculations.\n    Now since the ratio is r_s:r_b= (2*r_b):r_b i.e., she takes three times as much time:\n      => t_s = 3*t_b\n       We know that value of 't' or t_b above was calculated using same unit - hours which matches our target for final calculation.\n13.

Since her walking rate is two times faster on the sidewalk, we can express it as 2x miles per minute.\n\nGiven that she walks a total of 11 miles on the beach and spends 44 minutes doing so, we can find her speed by dividing distance (11 miles) by time (44 minutes).\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\n= 11 miles / 44 minutes\nHowever, since this is Kimia's rate for walking on the beach, it does not directly help us with finding x.\n\nLet's analyze our information again. We know that her sidewalk speed is twice as fast as her beach speed (2x). To find out how much time she spends on the sidewalks, we need to first determine what 18 miles of sidewalk walk at a rate of 2 times faster would take in minutes, given x.\n\nSince Kimia walks 11 miles at the slower speed 'x' and an additional distance needs to be covered by walking twice as fast (on the sidewalks), let's express her total time for both beach and sidewalk:\n\nTime on Beach = Distance / Speed\n= 44 minutes\n\nNow we need to find out how long she takes to walk 18 miles at a rate of '2x'. We can calculate it using:\nDistance / Rate * Time\nWe don't know the value yet, but let's denote her time spent walking sidewalks as T.\n\nTime on Sidewalks = Distance (sidewalk) / Speed (sidewalk)\n= 18 miles / (2*x)\n\nSince we already have an expression involving x from 'time taken at beach', and a relation for sidewalk speeds in terms of 'x' - it seems like using this might not be the best approach, so let's analyze time on sidewalks differently.\n\nWe are given that her speed is twice as fast. However since 44 minutes were spent walking a slower distance (11 miles) we cannot directly calculate how long she spends at sidewalk speeds without making an assumption about Kimia's rate - which isn't necessary in this case because of information provided, hence:\n\nSince the total time for both beach and sidewalks must add up to her overall walk duration T = Total Distance / Rate\nT = 29 miles / (11/44 + 18/(2* x))\n\nHowever we don't know 'x' or rate of sidewalk - but fortunately this isn't required as well, because given that she spends a portion of time walking at two times faster speed than the rest on her total walk.\n\nSince we already have information about how much distance is covered by Kimia and in which proportion. Thus let's compute:\n\nWe know 44 minutes were spent for 11 miles - hence rate = Distance/Time.\n= 11 / (44/(60)) \n\nHowever, here we don't need to calculate the time at beach since she spends total of 'T' minutes on both sidewalk and her known distance.\n\nSince speed is twice as fast in sidewalks than it was during walk over a slower path - there should be proportion between them. We also know that for every unit time taken by x miles per minute, two units are spent walking at rate 2x.\nBut given this setup seems like to get the desired result we would need more data (i.e., one of her speed) or additional details.\n\nHowever since she spends total walk in minutes - and we do know that sidewalk distance is double than beach path. \n\nSo let's directly compute time spent on sidewalks by using a formula derived from given information:\n\nTime = Total Distance / Rate\n= 29 miles \nSince the rate for sidewalk can be expressed as (2 * x) where 'x' denotes her speed in walking at slower pace.\n\nThe total distance covered is of two types - one type being beach path, which takes up 11/44 time unit and other being the slow-paced part covering 18 units. The latter requires less amount of time when compared to faster paced counterpart but we can still determine it by setting up proportionality with 'x'.\n\nGiven that sidewalk distance (18 miles) is twice as much than beach path - in terms of her walk speed, hence:\n\nTime spent at Sidewalks = 18/2 \n= Time spent on slower pace * 3 \n\nAnd this value would be equal to Total Distance / Rate\nNow we can calculate:\nTotal Walk Duration T (in minutes) is then given by combining both sidewalk and beach time as follows:\nSince speed of sidewalk path is double, i.e., twice the rate 'x'.\nSo total walk duration will be:\n\n= 11 * 44/(2*18)\n = Time taken on slower pace \nTherefore\nTotal Walk Duration T (in minutes) can now easily be determined.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is $\\boxed{16.89}$.",

We can use this information to find her rate of speed (x) when she's walking on the beach:\n\nRate = Distance / Time\nDistance walked on the beach: 15 miles\nTime taken for beach walk: 60/2 hours since it is in minutes, convert time into minute so we have total of one hour as distance is given in mile \nx = 15 miles/(60/2)\nx = (15*2) / 60 \n\nNow that we know her rate on the beach and sidewalk, let's find out how long she spends walking.\n\nSince Mei walks at two times the speed when walking on the sidewalk:\nDistance walked on sidewalk: 13 miles\nTime taken for sidewalk walk = Distance/speed of sidewalk \n= (2x * t) where 't' is time in minutes that she will spend to cover this distance and her rate was already calculated as x, so let's plug our value into equation we get \n\n13/((15*2)/60)\n13*(30 / 15)\n\nThis simplifies to: \n(13)(2)\n\n\nStep by step reasoning done.

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. Let's denote the speed at which Rania walks on the beach as 'x' km/min.\n2. Since she walks three times faster on the sidewalk, her speed is 3x km/min.\n3. The distance covered while walking on the beach is given as 12 kilometers and it takes 48 minutes to cover this distance. \n   We can write an equation: Distance = Speed * Time\n   So we have: 12 = x * (48/60) because speed in a minute should be converted into km/min by multiplying with 1 hour or dividing by 60.\n4. Simplify the above equation, which is:\n   12 = x * (0.8)\n5. Solve for 'x' to get her walking on the beach at 15 km/min.\n6. Since she walks three times faster on the sidewalk than on the beach,\n   we can write: Speed_on_sidewalk = 3 * 15\n                  = 45 km/min\n7. The total distance covered by Rania is given as 30 kilometers and it consists of 12 kilometers (beach) + 18 kilometers (sidewalk).\n8. Now, to find out the time taken for her to complete this entire walk,\n   we will first calculate the time she spends on walking on both beach and sidewalk.\n9. Time_on_beach = Distance / Speed\n               = 48/60 \n              = 0.8 minutes (since already converted)\n10. Time_on_sidewalk = Total Sidewalk_distance / Speed_on_sidewalk\n                      = 18 km / (45 km/min)  \n                     = 40% of the total time taken, which is given by:\n                  Time_taken_total = Time_on_beach + (Time_on_sidewalk *100/60)\n                             = 0.8 minutes+((40*1)/60minutes )\n                             =  48 / 60\n                            =   4/5 \n\nAnswer: The final answer is $\\boxed{0.8}$",

Now, let's calculate how many chemistry questions Aisha is sure to get since a quarter of the chemistry questions will be correct.\n   Chemistry questions she'll answer correctly = Total number of chemistry items * Quarter \n (1/4)\n = 18 * (1/4)\n = 4.5\n\nHowever, we can't have half points in this context so it's better to say that Aisha is sure to get at least a quarter of the total for each type.\n\n5. Now let's find out how many literature questions she'll answer correctly.\n   Literature items she'll correct will be same as chemistry since they are equally divided\n   Hence, \n    Number of literature items = 4\n\n6. To calculate her points from algebra: Aisha is sure to get all the four.\n\n7. For Chemistry and literature:\nTo find out how many questions each type has in total that can contribute towards scoring, we need to assume she gets at least one correct.\n   Hence,\n    Algebra Score : 1\n     Chemistry score : .25 * (18 items) = 4.5 \n     Literature score: .25* (18items )=  4.50\n\nSince you cannot get a fraction of the point, Aisha is sure to get at least one correct item for each type.\n\n8. Now let's sum up all her scores.\n   Total points she'll surely get = Algebra + Chemistry + Literature\n = 1 (algebra) + .25*18+ (.25)*18 \n = 4\n\nHowever, since you cannot score a fraction of the point in this context,\n Aisha is sure to get at least one correct item for each type.\n\n9. Since she gets only whole points we need to round off her scores.\n   Hence\n    Total minimum points=1+0.5*18 = 13\n\nAnswer: The final answer is $\\boxed{13}$.",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to find out how many literature questions there are in the 50-item quiz.\n   Since 20% of the questions are literature, and there are a total of 50 questions,\n   we can calculate the number of literature questions as:\n   \n   Number of literature questions = Total questions * Percentage of literature\n   = 50 * (20/100)\n   = 10\n\n2. Next, we need to find out how many economics and history questions there are.\n   We know that these two subjects divide the remaining percentage equally,\n   so each subject has:\n   \n   Number of Economics or History questions = Total Questions - Literature Questions\n   = 50 - 10\n   = 40\n\n3. Since they divide this number evenly, we can find out how many economics and history questions there are by dividing it into two equal parts.\n   \n   Each type (economics & history) has:\n   \n   Number of each subject's question = Total Economics or History Questions / 2\n   = 40 / 2\n   = 20\n\n4. Now, we can find out how many literature questions Jasmine is sure to get by using the given percentage.\n   \n   Literature points = Percentage * Total Questions\n   \n   Since she gets all of them:\n   \n   = (100/1) * 10 \n   However since this would give her more than possible total amount - lets try another way. Let's say that there are x literature questions and y economics and history questions where x + y is the same as how many items are in a quiz which we know to be equal to:\n   \n    (x+y) = 50\n   We also have: \n     Since she gets all of them, then total number of correct answers must be at least of literature points. In turn that means total questions - incorrect ones.\n    \n   The minimum amount of questions Jasmine is sure to get would come from the highest probability answer:\n   \n    So lets say (1/2) * y = 20 since she gets all economics and half history which makes sense, \n      therefore x + y must be equal to: 50. Then we solve for y.\n    \n   Therefore, let's try solving this using algebra first - then see how it goes:\n   \n     Let the number of literature questions Jasmine is sure to get = x\n    And the total amount that can't possibly go wrong since she gets half of economics and history is equal to (1/2) * y.\n\n     Since we know from above equations, \n       That 20% will be a good answer as it would give her: \n\n      So Jasmine must have at least x = literature questions. This also means that the total points can't possibly go wrong since she gets all of these.\n     \n    Therefore (x + y) /2 should not exceed half amount because we don't know for sure what value y is going to take.\n\n     Now, let's plug in values: \n\n   We have:\n \n      10 * x = number of literature questions Jasmine can possibly get. This must be less than or equal to (1/4) of total possible points.\n   \n    And also the following equation since she gets half economics and history\n       y +x=50\n    \n     Let's plug in some values into these equations, if we try 10 * x = number of literature questions Jasmine can possibly get. This must be less than or equal to (1/4) of total possible points:\n   \n      Since there are a maximum of 100 possible answers since she has half economics and history - which is the most difficult portion for her.\n     And also because if we take x=10, y =40.\n\n       The amount Jasmine can get from literature questions will be: \n         So let's calculate it using another method. If Jasmine gets all of these 10 * (1/2) or just half and she has no way to know how many economics answers are going right as well so we must use the other equation.\n   \n   The number that can possibly get is less than x = literature questions which gives us: \n     So if we plug in some numbers into these equations, let's say Jasmine gets a total of 25 points from the quiz. If this happens then she will be wrong and we don't need to do any more work as her answer was already calculated.\n   \n   However since that is not possible because it exceeds half amount - lets use another way:\n   \n   The number of literature questions = x \n     Since Jasmine gets all of them, the maximum points from these 10 * (1/2) or just half would be equal to: \n\n         Number of Literature Questions Jasmine Can Get Points From.\n    \n    Since there is no possible answer greater than this - lets say that if she got some other value then we don't need to do any more work because her point calculation will exceed what the total quiz points can possibly go up to.",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\nTo find out how many 15-minute episodes Luca watched on Tuesday, we need to first calculate the total number of hours he watched TV from Sunday to Thursday.\n\nOn Sunday and Monday, Luca watched a 4-hour episode each night. So in two nights (Sunday and Monday), he watched 2 * 4 = 8 hours.\nOn Wednesday, Luca also watched a 45-minute show which is equal to 0.75 hour. Adding this to the previous total: 8 + 0.75 = 8.75 hours\nOn Thursday, he watched two episodes that each lasted for three hours (3 * 2) = 6 hours.\nAdding all these together we get a grand total of: \n   - Sunday and Monday (4 x 2): 8  \n   - Wednesday episode + 45 minutes: 0.75   \n   - Thursday's Episodes:  6 \n\nSo now adding the above calculated values, Luca watched: \n    = 8 hours\n+     + 8.75 hours    \n      +        +       6\n\n= 23 Hours.\n\nSince he only had a total of 19 hours in all then to figure out how many episodes (15 minute) were played on Tuesday we should do the following:\nThe equation for this is: \nTotal watched = Episodes that are longer than 15 minutes + Episodes that are less than or equal to 15 minutes\n\nWe have already calculated that he spent a total of 23 hours watching TV and only had 19, so the difference between these two values represents how many episodes were played on Tuesday.\nSo let's say 'x' is number of hour long shows watched (episode longer than 15 mins), then we can set up equation as follows:\n\nTotal watched = Episodes that are longer than 15 minutes + Episodes that are less than or equal to 15 minutes \n\nor \n19 = x hours   Episode watching time\n\nNow subtracting 'x' from total number of episodes in order to get the episode which is a single 15 min show: \n23 - x (episode long) will give us, this value represents how many hour-long shows he watched.\n\nWe already know that on Wednesday Luca had both an hour long and half hours so lets denote these as 'a' for hour long episodes. Now we have to find the number of episode lengths which is more than 15 minutes but less or equal to one hour (we'll use this later).\n\nSo our equation now looks like: \n23 - x = Episodes that are a single 15 min show\n\nNow looking at Luca's schedule, on Tuesday he watched both an episode long and half episodes. So if we say 'x' is number of episodes long then for Wednesday the value of (a + b) would be:\nFor example: If we assume that one hour was equal to x = 1 Episode \nThen a would represent hours in terms of Episodes\nb will also represent same thing but for half episode length.\nHere, assuming 'x' is number of episodes long then \n\nWednesday's schedule can now be written as follows:\na + b where:    (value of 'a') represents the one hour or 1 Episode \n               and          value of   'b)' = Half an Hour or a Single 15 minute show.\n\nNow looking at Luca's TV watching, we know that for Sunday to Monday he watched only episodes long. Hence on Wednesday when we said 'x' is number of episode longs then 'a + b' should also be equal to x.\nSo here our equation now looks like: \n23 - x = Episodes that are a single 15 min show\n\nWe already know that for Sunday and Monday he watched only episodes, which means no half hour shows were played so on Wednesday we can represent it as follows:\nLet's say (x) represents the episode length where one hour is equal to 'x'. \nNow representing our equation in terms of x: \n\na + b = a  + (1 - a)\n=   1\nWe have already determined this value above.\n\n23 - x = Episodes that are less than or equal to an hour long show\n\nSince we know the total time spent watching TV and only watched one type of episode for Sunday and Monday, then all other episodes must be either more or equally as much in length.\nLet's assume (a + b) represents a single 15 minute show where 'b' is half an hour so it will take two such shows to equal the value of just one long show.\n\n23 - x = Episodes that are less than or equal to an episode which lasts for more then 1 Hour\n\nNow let's express our equation in terms of total number of episodes we can say: \nTotal watched   + Episodes that last a single 15 minute time\nor \n\n19 hours      + (x) is the value for one hour long show\n\nOur final answer will now look like this:\nWe have to solve 'x' first by subtracting 19 from",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. Sanjay watched a 6-hour episode of his favorite show each night on Tuesday and Wednesday, so the total time he spent watching TV during these two nights is:\n   2 * 6 = 12 hours.\n\n2. On Friday, Sanjay watched a 2-hour episode and a 15-minute show. To make it easier to calculate later when combining minutes with other times in hours, we'll convert this into just hours for now.\n   So the total time he spent watching TV on Friday is:\n   2 + (15/60) = 2 + 0.25 = 2.25 hours.\n\n3. On Saturday, Sanjay watched three episodes of a show that lasted four hours each night. The total amount of time he spent watching this type of episode is:\n   4 * 3 = 12 hours.\n\nWe now have the following breakdowns for how many hours of TV he watched during those days:\n\n- Tuesday: 6\n- Wednesday: 6\n- Thursday (unknown episodes, but we will figure out total minutes to convert back into hours): unknown\n- Friday: 2.25\n\n- Saturday: 12\n\nSince Sanjay watches a few episodes on Thursday that are only 15-minute long and it's unclear how many he watched in those few episodes for now.\n\n4. If all of these were the sum of his TV watching days, we'd have:\n   Tuesday (6) + Wednesday (6) + Friday (2.25) = 14.25\n\nThe difference between total hours Sanjay spent watching TV on Saturday and what he already watched shows that there must be an additional time for Thursday.\n \n5. To find the amount of additional minutes from his viewing days, we take the remaining viewing day times after subtracting all others:\n   Total Viewing Time - (Tuesday + Wednesday + Friday) = 27 total hours\n   So: Additional View Time on Thursday/Friday/Saturday is equal to Saturday's TV time minus other days combined. This will be \n   27 total viewing minutes, 24 of which came from watching the longer shows and episodes:\n   \n6. Now that we know Sanjay watched a lot in those first few hours (12 + 2 =14), this leaves us with how many more he could have spent on Thursday/Friday/Saturday - it will be \n   Saturday's viewing time minus what is left after removing watching the other shows.\n   So, now let’s subtract all that we know and see if our math makes sense: Subtracting those times from 27 hours to get a result for minutes watched. Then dividing by 0.25 to find total number of episodes in these few days \n    (let's add this up):\n     Total viewing time - Other TV shows watching day\n   The only unknown is Thursday’s episode length which we can figure out using the following.\n   \n7. Now subtracting those values and checking for correct results:\n  First, convert Saturday total hours to minutes because that will give us our starting value: \n    (12 *60) = 720\n\n8. Then now calculate how much TV time in these days Sanjay actually spent watching - we have already established this as being equal to the difference between his viewing time and what was left:\n   Subtracting known values from total hours, then converting remaining minutes back into a number of episodes for Thursday/Friday/Saturday \n    (27) - 24 =3\n    Since all that’s left is 720 – 216 which makes us 504. Divide by the length per episode to determine how many he watched:\n   So dividing: \n     Total viewing time / Length of each TV show on Saturday or Friday night/Thursday evening for a total number of episodes.\n\n9. To find out this value, we need to divide 504 (which represents all hours watching after subtracting other days) by the length per episode in minutes and then round down since you can’t watch part an episode:\n   Length per TV show = 15 minutes\n   So: Total viewing time on Thursday/Friday/Saturday / Length of each \n     Which will be equal to total number of episodes. Now we calculate this value.\n   \n10. To find out how many he watched for these shows, divide the remaining hours watching by the length in one episode:\n    504/15 =33.\n\nWe now have our answer.\n\n\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 33.",

Her husband also gave her 6 more spoons from his own package. When she sampled the creme brulee using 7 spoons, there were still some left to set up at the table with Ava having 20 total.\n\nWe can write an equation based on this information:\n\nx + 6 = Total number of spoons - Number of samples\n\nSince Ava used 7 spoons for sampling and had a remaining amount after that, we should consider all the utensils she ended up using to set the table as well. We know from the statement that there were '20' total at the end.\n\nSo let's rewrite our equation considering this information:\nx + 6 = Total number of spoons - Number of samples\n   x + 6 = (Number in Ava package) + 7\n\nSubstituting, we have: \n    x + 6 = x+ 7 \n\nWe can now solve for 'x' by subtracting it on both sides.\n\nStep 1:\n- Subtract x from both sides to cancel out the variable.\n   x - x + 6 = (x-x) + 7\n\nStep 2:\nAfter subtraction we get, \n    6= 7 \n\nThis clearly can't be true for any number of spoons. The initial assumption was wrong; so let's re-analyze.\n\nInitial mistake: We assumed Ava had only one package initially.\n   Let's consider that she bought 'm' packages instead - the math remains same\n\nx + (number in each package) = 20\nSince her husband also gave a set, total number of spoons after sampling is given by:\n     m * Number per Package + 6 \n\nSubstituting: \n    x + m*Number/Package=   Total Spoons - Samples taken\n\nWe know the equation should be as follows to incorporate Ava's package 'm' times. Hence re-write and solve using correct information.\nx+m*N = (20-samples)\n\n\nHere, Number in Package is N \n\nStep 1:\n    x + m * N = (Total number of spoons after sampling) - samples\n\nWe already know that she sampled with a set of utensils equal to the '7' sample. \nHence we can write: \nx+m*N=20-samples\n       or,   x+m*N= 13\n\n\nStep 2:\nSince Ava's husband gave her 6 additional spoons from his package,\n    and he bought only one more set of utensils - i.e., N.\n\nSo the above equation should now be re-written as: \nx + m * Number/Package = (Total Spoons after sampling) - samples \n\nSubstituting 'm*N' with total number in Ava's packages:\n   x+m*N=x+6\n\nAnd since we have already derived that 'x+m*N= 13',\nStep3:\n    Solving for the values of N, by subtracting the two equations.\n\n    (x + m * Number/Package) - (x+m*N)\n          = (Total Spoons after sampling) - samples \n\n   Or,\n        x+6- ((x+m*N))\n\nSimplifying we get: \n      6=N(m)\n\nNow since N=Number in each package, and 'm' is number of packages bought by Ava.\nSo now the equation becomes:\n     Number in Package * (number of Packages) = 6\n\nSince both numbers are positive integers. We need to find two factors for 6 such that it can satisfy our condition.\n\n\nWe know that N should be an integer, so we try all possibilities.\n\n    If we assume 'm' as a single digit number - e.g., m=1\n         Number in Package * (Number of Packages) = 6 \n\nBut the only possible pair is: \n   N =2 and m =3\n\nSince both numbers should be positive integers.\n\n\nNow, we can find value for x:\n    Using equation 'x+m*N=x+6'\n        or,\n      x +mN-x=6\nor\n         (Number in Package) * 1=6\n\n\nSubstituting the values of N and m into it: \n   2*3 = 6\n\nThe numbers satisfy our condition.

Then, Winnie used 8 forks for sampling creme brulee, so she was left with ((x + 17) - 8) or (x + 9) forks after using some for tasting and before setting the table.\n4. We are given that when Winnie went to set the table, she had a total of 26 forks in her possession at that moment which means the remaining number of forks left from package was added with the new ones purchased by husband i.e., \n   (x + 9) = someforks+17.\n5. The problem statement says - \"Later when Winnie went to set the table, she had a total of 26 forks\" , So we know that all forks in her possession were used while setting the tables and rest is stored somewhere else i.e., (someforks + 17).\n6. Let's rephrase equation no.4 as:\n   x+9 = someforks+17.\n7. Now let's use this information to find out total number of forks present before Winnie started preparing her creme brulee and using them for tasting purpose i.e.,\n    (someforks + 17) - 8 should be equal to initial forks that were stored in the package i.e., \n      someforks+9 = x.\n8. Now equation no.7 is same as our equation no.5 so,\n   let's find out what we don't know: number of forks purchased by husband (someforks) and then use this information to solve for unknown variable 'x' in order to determine total initial forks present before any tasting was done i.e.,\n    Let us assume someforks = 17-x\n9. Substitute the value from equation no.8 into our equations \n   x + 9 = (17 - x) + 17.\n10. Now simplify this expression by solving for unknown variable 'x' in order to find total number of forks that were initially present before Winnie purchased any new set i.e.,\n\nStep-by-step simplification:\n\n    x+9=(17-x)+17\n   => x+9=34 - x \n  =>2 * x =34-9 \n     =>2*x=25\n       =>x = (25/2)\n        :x:11.25 \n\nSince the number of forks cannot be fractional, this would not make sense in a real-world scenario.\n\nLet's re-evaluate our equations:\n\n1) assume that someforks = x -8 i.e.,\n   equation no 5 is rewritten as:\n      x +9=x-8+17\n    =>x=16\n\nAnswer: The final answer is $\\boxed{16}$.",

Her husband also gave her 13 more forks, so now she has x + 13 forks.\n\nKimia used 8 forks to sample her roast chicken. This means that after using those forks, the total number of forks left is still equal to the initial amount (x + 13) minus the number of forks Kimia used (which was already included in this sum).\n\nHowever, we're told she had a total of 26 forks at some point while setting up her table. So essentially, after using those 8 forks, and considering that it's still part of x+13, but now also including whatever other original package number, the equation is:\n \nx + 13 = Total forks - Forks used\nWe are not given how many forks she had before buying a new one; we only know she bought 'a' (which equals to) some unknown amount. Therefore we should rephrase our approach.\n\nInitially there were no forks and then Kimia received x, her husband gave 13 more. So now the equation is:\n\nTotal number of forks = Forks after receiving initial package + additional 13 forks\nWe know that she ends up with 26 forks at some point while setting the table.\nHowever we also should take into consideration what happened to those original forks - they were used but their total amount was included in a bigger set before. In this situation, there is no need for such complicated analysis as Kimia bought and her husband gave more than she had initially; that already accounted for.\n\nLet's just use the equation based on final number of forks after using some:\n \n26 = Initial package (x) + additional 13 forks - Forks used\nSince we don't know how many were there before buying a new one, let us rephrase this: total is x plus 13. And she ends up with 26 forks.\n\nSo the equation becomes,\n \n26 = Total number of forks after using some (which can also be written as Initial package + Additional ones)\nx + 13 - Number used\nWe already know that 'Number used' equals to 8 because it was explicitly stated in a problem.\nTherefore we rephrase this again and get:\n \n26 = x + additional amount which is equal to, or rather than being an equation for the total number of forks after using some (which can be written as initial package plus the new ones), but since that's not relevant here - let us just use simple formula. Total forks are 26, and we know she received 'a' more before this point.\n\nThe correct formulation is \n26 = Initial amount + additional 13 forks\n\nSince x denotes a number of forks in an initial package.\nSo now the equation becomes,\nx + 13 = 26 \n\nStep by step reasoning continued...\nNow let us just subtract from both sides to solve for 'x':\n \nx = 26 - 13\nThis calculation is straightforward and brings us directly to our goal.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 13.",

Since there are 4 quadruplets and each set consists of a cardigan, hat, vest, leg warmers, and booties, she'll need:\n\n- Cardigans: 5 skeins\n- Hats: 12 skeins\n- Vests: 6 skeins\n- Leg Warmers (a pair): Since it takes 9 skeins for one pair of leg warmers, we can multiply by the number of grandchildren to account for all pairs needed. So that would be: \n   - 2 * 4 = 8 sets or leg warmers.\n\n- Booties (a pair) and total calculation:\n   - Since it takes 9 skeins for one pair of booties, Jasmine will need a total of the same number since there are also 4 grandchildren. So that would be: \n    - 2 * 4 = 8 sets or leg warmers.\n\nTo calculate this problem more simply we could add all these amounts together with their corresponding quantities as follows:\n\n- Cardigans (5 skeins): 1 * 5\n- Hats (12 skeins): 4 * 12\n- Vests, Leg Warmers and Booties: Each of them would take the same amount. Since there are a total of four grandchildren:\n   - Let's call that 'x'.

Let's calculate the total weight (in grams) of popcorn available for consumption:\nSince each serving has a fixed amount of food but we don't know exactly what that is per gram and given multiple servings have been eaten already, to get an accurate number let's do this differently.\nFirst find out how many calories are in 200g bag. \nNumber of calories = Calories per serving * Number of servings\nCalories available for the whole weight (200 grams) = 250 * 5\n\nSince we've consumed some amount from that so lets say total amount of food is x and you have eaten y.\nx -y= 200 \n\nAlso, since each serving has a fixed number calories. \nTotal Calories in the bag = Number of servings * Calories per Serving\nFor this example let's use the whole weight for calculation. Since we don't know how many grams are left after consumption so lets say you have eaten y amount.\nSo total amount consumed (y) is equal to 5 times calories per serving.\n\nSince daily calorie limit is fixed at 2300 and already, a certain number of calories has been consumed that's given in the problem statement as 1050. So remaining calories for eating more can be calculated by \nRemaining Calories = Daily Limit - Consumed Calorie\n\nTo find out total weight (in grams) you need to divide it with calories per serving.\nSo first let us calculate how many servings are left and then we will see what is the final answer.\n\nStep 1: Total amount of food consumed so far\nConsuming x gram of popcorn gives 250 calorie. \nx -y =200 \n\nWe already know daily limit for calorie consumption, which is 2300.\nRemaining Calories= Daily Calorie Limit- Consumed calories (already given)\nTotal calories available from the whole weight bag can be found by: Total amount *Calories per serving\nSince you have eaten a certain portion of that so let's find out total number servings and then we will get remaining grams.\n\nStep 2: Calculate daily calorie limit - already consumed \nRemaining Calories=2300-1050\n\nNow calculate the value.\nRemaining calories =1250 \n\nStep 3: Total amount (x) *Calories per serving\n250*5=1250 \n\nSince it is equal to Remaining Calorie, this means that there are no leftover servings. You have already consumed all of them.\n\nSo now we need to find out total grams available for consumption.\nTotal calories in a 200-gram bag = Number of servings * Calories per Serving \nAs shown above Total amount (x) *Calories per serving\n250*5=1250 \n\nStep 4: Calculate the value. \nSince you have already consumed all your portion, it is not possible to consume more than that.\n\nSo now let us find out total grams available for consumption.\nIf x represents whole weight in gram and y represents amount of popcorn eaten then we can say,\nx-y=200\n\nNow here's where things get tricky\nTotal calories from a 200-gram bag = Number of servings * Calories per Serving \nSince you have already consumed some portion so to find the remaining grams available let us consider this equation:\ny / x = Number of Servings/ Total amount in gram \n\nFor example: if there were only two portions and total weight is 250g then number of servings will be 2. So y/x=2.\n\nBut we can't do that as our numbers are not like those.\nSo lets say for a certain portion, let's assume it was 1 serving instead of x \ny/5 = remaining calories /Calories per serving \n\nSince you have already consumed some amount so to find out the value of y (total weight) available we can't do that directly.\n\nWe need total number servings first.\nBut here is how: Total calorie consumption for a certain portion will be equal to 250 * Number of Servings\nSo if remaining calories are there then it means you haven't consumed all your portions and therefore the whole bag still contains those un-eaten grams available.",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to find the total number of servings in a 350 ounces bag. We are given that there are 7 servings per serving size.\n2. Since it's mentioned \"a bag\", I assume the phrase 'per serving' is being used here instead referring to a serving size and so this implies each ounce has one serving - thus, for every single ounce we have seven of these individual units (servings).\n3. Therefore total number of servings = 350 ounces * 1 servicing per oz \n4. So total servings in the bag will be equal to: 7 servings/oz * 350 oz\n   Total Servings = 2450.\n5. Next, we need to find out how many more calories are left for us before reaching our daily calorie target of 2425.\n6. The remaining number of calories is given by subtracting the already consumed calories from the total required calories: \nRemaining Calories= Daily Calorie Target - Already Consumed Calories\n   = 2425 cal - 1525 cal  \n7. This can be computed as follows:\n   Remaining Calories= 905cal.\n8. Now, let's find out how many servings we need to consume in order to achieve the remaining calories: \n9. Each serving has 450 calories and so number of required servicing = total needed calories/ calorie per unit\n10. Required Servings= Total Remaining Calorie /Calories Per Serving  \n11. This can be computed as follows:\n   RequiredServings = 905 cal/ 450cal\n12. The result is: Required Servings=2.\n13. As we have already consumed some servings and now need to find how many ounces you will eat for remaining required servicing, \n14. Total Consumed Serving in this case would be equal to total available serving plus the number of additional services needed - i.e., 7 +2\n15. Hence the amount eaten = (required Servings) * (calories per oz)\n16. As each 'servicing' has one ounce: RequiredServings= required servings \n17. Finally, we can calculate how many ounces will be consumed:\n   Amount Eaten=RequiredServings*1oz  \n18. This computation is equivalent to computing 2 *1 which gives us the amount of Ounces you eat\n19. The result is = 2 oz.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 2.",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\nTo solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps. We need to find out how many ounces of bread can be consumed given the calorie target and remaining calories.\n\n1. Calculate total daily allowed servings: \nWe know that our daily calorie limit is 2360 calories and each serving has 275 calories.\nTotal daily allowed servings = Total daily calorie limit / Calories per serving\n= 2360 / 275\n≈ 8.55\n\nSince we can't consume a fraction of a serving, let's round down to the nearest whole number for now (we'll check later).\nSo, approximately 8 servings are allowed.\n\n2. Calculate total calories already consumed: \nWe have already eaten 1700 calories out of our daily target.\nRemaining calorie allowance = Total daily calorie limit - Calories already consumed\n= 2360 - 1700\n= 660\n\n3. Find the number of remaining ounces:\nSince each serving has approximately 8 servings allowed and we know that a 300-ounce bag contains 5 servings, \nFirst find calories per ounce in one serving: \nCalories in 1 oz = Calories per serving / Number of slices\nAssuming standard bread is sliced into equal pieces (let's assume it's cut into the same number as in total amount), we can approximate this directly:\nWe know that a bag has 275 calories and contains 5 servings. So, one slice or ounce will contain approximately: \nCalories per ounce = Calories in serving / Number of slices\n= 275/ (300 * 1) since assuming each is the same size.\n≈ 0.917\n\nHowever for simplicity let's say we know a single piece has an approximate value as follows:\nAssuming total amount equals number of servings times ounces: \nA bag contains 5 serving units and thus, \n= 275 calories / (300 oz * 1) since each slice is equal\n≈ 0.917\n\nNow multiply the allowed daily ounce consumption with a standard size for ease to approximate actual remaining:\nAssume one full \"standard\" piece has an amount we can use as follows: let's take this approximation and assume that if our target was set at serving sizes of 'x' units, it would equal 275 calories.\nIf there were only single unit servings available (one slice), then \n= Total daily calorie allowance / Calories per standard serving\nSince one full piece is equivalent to the total amount we have: let's approximate with this assumption for simplicity:\nAssuming our target size equals 'x' and using our original equation, it seems reasonable that if a bag has 5 \"standard\" pieces (slices) then each must weigh \n300/5 = 60 ounces.\nWe now know what an ounce represents in terms of calories per unit: \n1 oz * .917 ≈ 275 total calories.\n\nNow let's consider the simplified approach using standard slice assumption for ease:\n= Total daily calorie allowance / Calories per serving\n≈ 8.55\n\nGiven that, since we have a target size 'x' and our goal is to find how many ounces of bread can be consumed (assuming it equals one full unit), \nwe know each ounce represents approximately .917 calories.\nWe want total number of standard slices or units for remaining allowance:\n= Total daily calorie limit / Calories per serving\n≈ 8.55\n\nSince we've already used up the amount equivalent to 'x' servings, let's simplify this calculation by assuming that one full slice is equal in size and weight as a single piece.\nWe can approximate how many ounces are allowed remaining: \nRemaining allowance = Total daily calorie limit - Calories already consumed\n= 2360 calories / .917 per standard unit ≈ 2571.5 units but we've used the amount of 'x' or servings.\n\nFor simplicity let's assume total number of \"standard slices\" in bag equals to its weight, using this information and simplifying:\nAssume a single piece is equal to one slice (or ounce), then\n= Number of ounces available remaining / .917 calories per standard unit \nSince the actual amount we have left would be equivalent to 5 units less than 'x' servings. So total slices are: \n\nSo let's calculate how many \"standard\" pieces or slices can be eaten:\nIf x is our target size, then\nTotal daily allowed = Total number of ounces available / .917 calories per unit.\n= Number of standard sizes * Calories in one serving (using this to represent a single 'x' slice)\nUsing the simplified calculation we know that \n1. Since each \"standard\" piece equals 275 total calories divided by x slices, then:\n2. To calculate remaining allowance: Total daily calorie limit - Calories already consumed\n= Number of standard sizes * Calories in one serving (using this to represent a single 'x' slice)\n\nNow let's simplify the calculation for ease using our target size and original equation.\n\nLet's consider that we know total number of \"standard slices",

Multiply 20 anchors: \n    20 * ₺0.39 = ₺7.80\n2. Multiply remaining 6 anchors (since we are buying all 26):\n    6 * ₺0.39 = ₺2.34\n3. Add both amounts:\n   ₺7.80 + ₺2.34 = ₺10.14\n\n5.

Money remaining = Initial amount - Total cost \n   = ₺66.14 - ₺10.14\n\nStep by step subtraction:\n₺65.00\nAfter buying 6 anchors: \n- ₺0.39 * 20 \n= ₺7.80 ( anchor price multiplied to number of other six)\nTotal after subtracting all prices from the initial amount.\nHowever, it can be simplified using simple arithmetic.\n\n2.

Now, let's calculate the total additional fees by adding brokerage and transfer fees together.\n   Total fees = Brokerage fee + Transfer fee\n              = $17500 + $35000\n              = $52500.\n\n4. The next step is to find out the total price of the apartment which includes selling price and all the additional fees.\n   Total cost of the property = Selling price + Total fees\n                           = $350000 + $52500\n                           = $402500.\n\n5. Since Ms. Johnson has a budget of $370000, let's calculate how much more she needs to pay compared to her budget.\n   Additional amount needed = Total cost - Budget limit\n                          = $402500 - $370000\n                          = $32500.\n\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 32500.",

After 4 more weeks, Sakura will have a total of (32 + x) signatures\n   - And Mei will have a total of (54 + y)\n\n7.

The charity has agreed to cover 1/6 of this amount, so we need to calculate what fraction James needs to pay for himself.\n3. To find out how much James needs to pay, subtract 1/6 from 1 (since he doesn't have to pay the remaining 5/6). \n   First convert whole number one into a fraction with common denominator: 1 = 6 / 6\n4. Now we can calculate what fraction of total cost James has to cover by performing subtraction:\n    Fraction that James needs to cover = (6 - 1) / 6\n   So, the calculation will be 5/6.\n5. Multiply this fraction with conference costs: \n     Amount James needs to pay himself = Total Cost * (Fraction he is responsible for paying)\n       That gives us: ₣240 × (5/6)\n\nStep by step multiplication:\n1. Convert whole number into fractional form, then multiply both fractions together\n   Fraction that we want to find out the amount of conference costs 240 will be multiplied with fraction 5 / 6.\n   This is equivalent to multiplying numerator and denominator separately,\n     Numerator: 240 × (5/6) = 1200/6 \n      Denominator remains same i.e, 6 \n\n2. Now simplify this result:\n    Amount James needs to pay himself can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator with common divisor of two\n   The simplification is as follows:\n     1200 ÷ (common factor) = 600 /3 \n      6 ÷(Common Factor)= 1/1 \n\n   Since we want only final answer. So lets proceed to find out the amount that James needs.\n   \n3. To get rid of fractions let's multiply by reciprocal\n   The denominator will be multiplied with inverse i.e, (1/1) which is equal to one and finally give us:\n    Amount James has: 600\n\n4. Subtract this from total cost to see how much he still needs \n   But since amount that james need = Total Conference Cost - what James already have\n      And we know conference cost in question will be 240 and the final answer is also related with fraction so lets continue step by step:\n       The given amounts can now directly subtracted using this fact.\n    So, let's see how much James needs: \n        Amount he still need = Conference Cost - what already has him\n   Now do subtraction to find out amount of money that James needs more:\n\n5. 240-600=-360\n\n\nAnswer: The final answer is -360",

We know that together they eat all 24 pieces available on the pizza per day.\n3. So, we can create an equation to represent their daily food consumption:\n   - The total amount of food eaten by Roya and Mei each day equals the total number of slices: x + 2x = 24\n4.

Since 'x' represents how many days it takes for them to finish all pizza together, and we know both their daily consumption rate (8 + 16), let's solve this:\n   - Calculate total food they eat per day: x is the number of days but Roya eats more than half which equals one fourth as a whole or '4'. \n     Therefore total eaten each time for them to finish pizza will be 24/3.\n\nStep by step reasoning complete.

Therefore, we need one more variable X that represents total minutes spent on cleaning per day.\n   To find x,\n    Total time of rooms cleaned (in mins)= Number of hours/day*60*10 /90\n      Let's assume it as 'x'\n        Hence the value will come out to be:\n          = 15 * 60 * 10/90 \n             Now divide this by total available minutes per day i.e. 150 and multiply with 100 for percentage.\n       Therefore,\n         Total time spent on cleaning rooms\n            ((x /30) *2)* 100",

Since Isabella is buying a combination pack that includes 20 kilograms (15 + 5) and she only scooped up 22 kilograms, we need to calculate the cost for those extra two kilograms.\n   Extra Cost per kilogram = Price per kg - Discounted price per kg\n                           = ₺21 - (√(2/3) * ₺21)\n                            ≈ ₺21 - (0.8165 * ₺21)\n                            ≈ ₺21 - ₺17.16\n                            ≈ ₺3.84\n\n   Now, let's calculate the total cost for those extra two kilograms.\n   Total Extra Cost = Price per kg + Discounted price per kg\n                     = ₺21 + ₺3.84\n                     = ₺24.84\n\n   So the initial 15kg pack would have been discounted by (5/23) or approximately .2174 of its value and then multiplied with 22 to get our final cost, however we can simplify this calculation.\n    Cost for extra kg = Extra kilograms * Price per kilogram + Discounted price per kilogram\n                     ≈ ₺2.84\n\n3.

First, let's find out how much she paid for 15 kilograms (the bulk purchase) at ₣23 per kilogram.\n   The weight she bought was more than that in set so lets first do those \n   Cost = Weight * Price per kg\n   For the rock candy:\n   Weight of rock candy purchased = 21 - 15 = 6 kg\n   Since we know her got a deal on these. There is actually an error here as it says get 4 kgs in one and four quarters off so lets first do that portion, then you can calculate for total cost \n   We will come back to this weight after the mixed bag.\n\n2. For the rock candy:\nSince she gets 1/4 of a kilogram (0.25 kg) off per kg purchase\nFor every set of kilograms purchased there is one fourth less than what was purchased.\nSo if we assume for simplicity that her bulk amount of kilograms purchased was divisible by four, then after first calculating cost the remainder will be discounted and you can just add the 4 kgs at full price.\n\nWeight of rock candy purchased = 6 kg\nFor every set of four, there is one fourth off. \nSo if we divide it into sets:\n- Six divided by four gives us two (2).\n- So for these two kilograms she has to pay for three times because the discount applies once per kilogram.\n   She also pays full price for last 4 kgs\nCost = Weight * Price per kg * Sets purchased \n= 6*23*(3) + 0.25\n\nBut that is not how we actually calculate it since there are only two sets of four kilograms in this problem so the above statement can be disregarded.\n\nShe pays full price for first 4 and gets a discount on last 2.\nCost = Weight * Price per kg\n= (6 - 1/4)*23 + 0.25*23 \n\n3. Calculate cost using decimals to avoid fractions:\n- First four kilograms at regular price: \n   Cost of the first 4 kgs = 4 * 23\n   Cost of discount on last two kgs:\n     The weight she gets for her discount is (6 - 1/4) or 5.75 kg.\n      So cost of this set of rock candy purchased at full price would be \n         Weight*Price per kilogram \n        = 5.75 *23 \n\nSince it says to get a deal on the last four, so lets calculate that:\nWeight of rock candies bought (first part) is: 4 kgs\nCost for first set of kilograms:\n   Cost= weight*kilograms price\n    Cost = 4*23\n\nFor second set we have already calculated cost as above.\nSo total cost to get all the rock candy would be \n     Totalcost=(Weight *Price per kg)* Sets purchased  \n          First part of rock candies bought at regular price: 4 kilograms, Price is ₣23\n            Cost = weight*kilograms price= (4*23)\n           Second set we already calculated as above.\n   So total cost for the rock candy:\n    Totalcost=(weight *Price per kg)* Sets purchased  \n        Weight of second part of rock candies bought: 5.75, Price is ₣23\n          Cost = weight*kilograms price= (5.75*23)\n         Now add two costs to get final total cost for the rock candy:\n     Totalcost=(weight *Price per kg)* Sets purchased  \n        First part of rock candies bought at regular price: 4 kilograms, Price is ₣23\n            Cost = weight*kilograms price= (4*23) \n           Second set we already calculated as above.\n   So total cost for the rock candy:\n    Totalcost=(weight *Price per kg)* Sets purchased  \n        Weight of second part of rock candies bought: 5.75, Price is ₣23\n          Cost = weight*kilograms price= (5.75*23)\n         Now add two costs to get final total cost for the rock candy:\n    Totalcost=(weight *Price per kg)* Sets purchased  \n        First part of rock candies bought at regular price: 4 kilograms, Price is ₣23\n            Cost = weight*kilograms price= (4*23) \n           Second set we already calculated as above.\n   So total cost for the rock candy:\n    Totalcost=(weight *Price per kg)* Sets purchased  \n        Weight of second part of rock candies bought: 5.75, Price is ₣23\n          Cost = weight*kilograms price= (4*23 +5.75*23)\n\nBut this can be simplified to \nFirst set cost for the rock candy at full regular price:\n   First set = 4 k",

First, let's calculate the cost of 16 pounds of saltwater taffy at ₺20 per pound: \n   Cost = Quantity * Price\n   Cost = 16 pounds * ₺20/pound\n   Cost = ₺320\n   \n2. Next, we need to find the discounted price for the additional 5 pounds and 1/4:\n   The discount on each of these extra 7 pounds (since 23 - 16 is 7) will be 25% (or 0.75 in decimal form). \n   Discounted Price = Quantity * Original Price * (1 - Discount Rate)\n   Discounted Price for the additional 5 pounds and 1/4:\n      Additional Cost to discount: (5 + 0.25)/4 = 6.25 / 4 pounds, but we'll use total extra weight which is 7 pound \n        Since our quantity of 16 already accounts for one full quarter pound in taffy purchase.\n   Discounted Price per Pound:\n      ₺20 * (1 - .75)\n      ₺5\n   Additional Cost after discount: 7 pounds at discounted rate: 7 * ₺5 = ₺35\n\n3. Now, we can calculate the total cost of saltwater taffy by adding the original price for 16 pounds to the additional discounted weight:\n   Total Saltwater Taffy Cost = Original Price + Discounted Additional Weight\n   Total Saltwater Taffy Cost = ₺320 (for first 16) + ₺35 \n   The problem with this step is that we don't have enough information. We actually need another equation for the total weight purchased or to know if Xena bought additional taffy at a different price.\n   \n4. To proceed, let's re-evaluate our previous calculations by assuming she only spent money on saltwater taffy and starfish: \n   Saltwater Taffy Cost = ₺320 + ₺35\n      However this calculation is still incorrect because Xena bought 23 pounds of it.\n\n5. Let's try another approach, assume we have the cost per pound for the extra weight purchased after buying first 16 (after discount) which would be at full price.\n   Additional Weight = Total Purchased - Initial Purchase \n          If she had only gotten saltwater taffy and starfish:\n      So additional pounds bought is: 23-16\n           7\n\n6. Since we know the total amount Xena spent on keychains, let's calculate that first:\n   Keychain Cost = Quantity * Price per item\n   Keychain Cost = 14 items * ₺20/each \n   Keychain Cost = ₺280 \n\n7. Now we can find the cost of saltwater taffy by adding its original price and discounted additional weight:\n   Total Saltwater Taffy Weight bought: Since there are no other prices for this, let's use initial purchase\n      We've already established that she got 16 pounds at ₺20 per pound.\n \n8.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of saltwater taffy.\n   - The sale includes 15 pounds at ¥23 per pound and then an additional 4 pounds with a discount.\n\n2. Calculate the original price for 19 pounds (15 + 4) without any discounts:\n   - Original weight = 15 * 1 = ¥23\n   - Additional discounted weight: \n     - To find how much of this is at full price, let's convert the fractional part to an improper fraction and then calculate what portion will be off. We can multiply it by a factor that allows us to easily subtract from total pounds purchased:\n       - Total pounds bought = 19\n       - Fractional discount: \n         (4 * 1/4) / 19  \n           Then we convert the whole number part into fractional form and combine with the fraction already multiplied, so we multiply by a factor that allows us to easily subtract from total weight purchased:\n             For ease of calculation let's use \"a\" for this multiplier. Since there are two numbers (the decimal portion and then 1), you would set up an equation as follows: \n                 - (4 * 0 + 1) = 19*a\n               a is thus equal to .25 or one-quarter.\n\n     Now we can multiply:\n         So the discounted amount for four pounds is equal to 23*(15) multiplied by this factor of one quarter, and then subtract from total weight.\n             The following will calculate it: \n   - (4 * 1/4) = 1 pound\n   - Since 19 represents a whole number portion we need multiply the value before discounting that part. To do so let's call our multiplier \"x\". We can solve for x by setting up this equation:\n      Total weight purchased * Multiplier = Weight not discounted \n            (19 * X) = 15\n   - Dividing both sides of this new equation gives us a solution to find what value we need, since the following will represent total weight before discounting:    \n    We can then multiply by our multiplier \"x\": x is equal to .95 or 19/20.\n            Weight not discounted * Multiplier = Total price \n                (15) * .95\n   - Now that you know how much of it was purchased at full price, let's add the two numbers together and find total cost:\n      Cost for saltwater taffy: ¥23(15)*(1/4) + 19*(.95)\n       =¥ (23*3.75)+(11.55)= \n         ≈89\n   - Calculate this using an equation with variables.\n    The above gives us the answer of $89.\n\n3. Next, calculate the cost for starfish:\n   - Cost: ¥11.75\n\n4. Now, let's find out how much money Sakura spent on keychains:\n   - Number of keychains = 13\n   - Price per keychain = ¥20.25\n   - Total price for keychains: \n       (13) *¥(20.25)\n    ≈¥264\n\n\n5. Calculate the total cost by adding up all expenses, including saltwater taffy:\n   - Cost of gift shop items + Cost of starfish + Cost of keychains = ¥89 + ¥11.75 + ¥264\n   Total: ¥364.75\n\n6. Subtract this amount from Sakura's initial budget to find out how much money she has left.\n    Initial Budget (Parent) :¥1400 \n    Money Left:\n       ¥( 1400 - 364.75 )  \n      ≈¥1035.25\n\n\nAnswer: The final answer is approximately ¥1035.25",

First, calculate the cost of fudge: The total weight is 23 pounds and for every 15 pounds, it costs ₺21 per pound with a discount on the extra half pound.\n   Since she bought in increments of 15 + 8 (half pound), we can find how many sets are there by dividing total pounds to the number required set. Total = 31/2 \n   The fudge cost is calculated as: Cost for full packs * no.of_full_sets+cost_of_half_pack\n   Here, it will be :21*15+(7.5) \n\n2. Now calculate how much Keisha spent on fudge:\nCost of fudge = (21 * 15 + 7.5)\n               = (315+7.5)\n               = ₺322.50\n\n3. Calculate the cost of postcards: \n   The total weight is not relevant here since she bought in a fixed unit.\n   Cost per postcard = ₺20.5\n   Number of postcards purchased= 15\n   \nCost for post cards = (number_of_postcards)*cost_per_postcard  \n                  =15*20.5   \n                 =₺307\n\n4. Calculate the cost of sand dollars: \nThe total weight is not relevant here since she bought in a fixed unit.\n   Cost per sand dollar = ₺11.50\n   Number of sand dollars purchased= 1\n   \nCost for sand dollars = (number_of_sand_dollars)*cost_per_sand_dollar  \n                    =$11.5*1    \n                   =₺11\n\nNow calculate the total cost:\nTotal money spent by Keisha on souvenirs and other items\n   Cost of fudge + postcards+sand dollars \n  = ₺322.50+₺307 + ₺11\n      =₺640.50 \n\n5. Now subtract this from her initial budget to determine how much she has left:\nKeisha's remaining money: \n    Initial Budget - Total Money Spent  \n   = ₺1400-₹640.50    \n     = ₺759.50\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 759.50",

At the seaside store, cotton candy was on sale for \"Buy 16 pounds at $22 per pound, get 5 pounds 1/4 off.\" She scooped up 23 pounds. She also bought a mixed bag of coral pieces for $11.5 and 16 pins that were $21.25 each. How much money does Rania have left?",

    "logic_problem": {
      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's calculate the cost of 16 pounds of cotton candy at $22 per pound.\n   Cost = Number of pounds * Price per pound\n         = 16 pounds * $22/pound\n         = $352\n\n2. Next, we need to find out how much Rania paid for the 5 pounds and a quarter off from the original price of $22 per pound. \n   The discount on these 5 pounds is (1/4) * $22\n             = ($0.25) * $22\n             = $5.50\n\n3. Now, we calculate the cost of these 5 pounds with the discount applied.\n   Cost for discounted cotton candy = Original price - Discount amount\n = $22 - $5.50\n = $16.50 per pound.\n\n4. So now Rania paid (15/1) * $16.50 \n                            = $247.50\n\nfor 11 pounds of the discounted cotton candy and then she bought another 10 more pounds at full price, so total cost for all cotton candy is: \n\nCost = Cost for 15 pounds with discount + Cost for remaining 7 pounds\n     = ($247.50) + (7 * $22)\n          = $247.50 + $154\n           = $401.50\n\n5. Now we can calculate the amount of money Rania spent in total:\n   Total cost = Cost of cotton candy + Cost of coral pieces + Cost of pins \n              = $401.50 + $11.50 + 16 * ($21.25)\n                  (for 23 pounds, she bought more than needed so it is a multiple purchase)\n\n6. Calculate the number of sets purchased by Rania:\n   Since each set contains 16 pounds and she has only bought for 23 pounds.\n   She must have purchased at least two full sets or one partial set with 3 extra pounds.\n\n7. We will use this information in our final calculations:\n\n   Cost per pound = $22 \n                  - discount amount is (1/4) * $22\n                           =$5.50\n\n   So cost for the first and second purchase of each cotton candy:\n       For full sets: (2 * 16 pounds set price)\n                   ($352 + 15 pounds discounted cotton candy at original rate = $401.50 \n                     or total amount paid to be more accurate)\n\n11. Calculate Rania's expenditure on pins\n   Cost for pins = Number of pins purchased * Price per pin \n               = 16 * (21.25 dollars each)\n                =$341\n\n12. Now let us add the cost calculated so far and then subtract from $1400:\n    Total amount spent by her: $401 + ($11.50) +$341\n                           = $753.50 \n\nNow, we will find out how much money she has left.\n \n13. Final calculation for remaining money Rania have after buying everything.\n   Money Left = Initial money - Total Amount Spent\n             =$1400-$753.5\n\nAnswer: The final answer is $\\boxed{646.50}$.",

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to find out how much he spends on tea for the entire week:\n   Weekly_cost_of_tea = Cost_per_day * 7 days/week = ₣8/day * 7 days/week = ₣56/week\n3. Next, let's calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of tea per kilogram, which is 25% higher than the normal price:\n   More_expensive_price_per_kg = Normal_price_per_kg + (Normal_price_per_kg * 0.25)\n               = ₣4/kg + (₣4/kg * 0.25)\n               = ₣5/kg\n   Since Santiago buys a week's worth of tea, we need to calculate how much he would spend on this brand for the entire week:\n   Weekly_cost_of_more_expensive_tea = More_expensive_price_per_kg * Number_of_days_in_week\n = ₣5/kg * 7 days/week\n = ₣35/week\n4.

Calculating this gives us the exact ratio, so it means for every girl we can say boys have same proportion as girls in actual numbers too\n6. The question says 'two-fourths' number of boys - that is also equal to saying total kids divided by four then multiplied by two and equals 10 which when done will be found out.\n   Therefore: \n(1/4) * Total Kids = (2 / 4)\nTotal Kids = ((2 / 4)) * 4\n   We now just need the number on RHS of equation. Since we know boys are twice girls so if you assume x as one girl then two-fourths would be same thing, \nSo:\nx + 2x  \n= Total Number of kids in playground.\n3x = Total Number of kids \n\nNow put total Kids from above to our first formula: (1/4) * 3x\n(1 / 4)*3 x = (Total number of boys)/4 which is equal to two-fourths girls i.e. \n10   and so this also equals one-half the number of boys.\nSo Total Number of kids will be same thing as above formula: 30 \n\nAnswer: The final answer is 15",

We can think of this as finding a pattern: \n- There's one flower initially\n- Then there's an empty space (of 12 ft)\n- Followed by another plant growing into it, effectively taking up its original width plus its growth width\n\n4. To make things easier to calculate we will start with the first and last spaces in between each 'plant'.\n   - The total length taken up for a single flower would be: \n     (width of one flower) + 12 feet \n\n5.

First calculate the total width for all plants using occupied length formula\n   we know space and flower's diameter\n\nTotal Space Width = 14*(26+12.5)\n= 14*38.5 \n\n2. Calculate the cost of flowers Priya will buy to fill her garden.\nCost for one plant: ¥7 \nNow multiply number of gaps with individual price per gap:\n- Multiply total length occupied by all plants and their prices.\n\n3. Subtract from bed's dimensions to get portion covered\n\nTo calculate, first subtract space width (calculated earlier) from entire flower-bed\n   - Total Space Width = 14 *38.5 \n     i.e., 539ft or 537 ft as we can't have fraction of a foot for this measurement.\n\nNow multiply the remaining length with price per plant to get final answer:\n- Remaining bed Length: total space width (calculated above) subtracted from flower-bed's dimension\n\nHere is calculation:\n\nStep-by-step Calculation\n1. Calculate Total Space Width \n   - Total occupied by flowers and gaps = 14 *38.5 \n\n2. Now multiply this with cost of one plant.\n   \n3. Subtract length taken up in bed (calculated above) with total available space for plants to get final answer.\n\nHere is calculation:\n- Length remaining: flower-bed size minus the width covered by all flowers including their gaps\n   i.e., 175ft - 537 ft = -362ft because we can't have negative numbers so this approach won't work \n    The issue here arises from incorrect assumption of total occupied space.

Since a dozen is equal to 12, we multiply 7 dozens by 12:\n   Total eggs = 7 * 12\n            = 84 eggs.\n\n2. Sakura finds 7 eggs.\n3. Theo finds thrice as many eggs as Sakura (which means three times the number of eggs found by Sakura):\n   Eggs found by Theo = 7 * 3\n                      = 21 eggs.\n4. Deshawn finds a quarter less than what DeShawn found:\n   Since we don't know how much is \"a quarter\" in this context, let's calculate it as (1/4) of the amount that was left after Sakura and Theo collected their share from Kayla's hidden 84 eggs.\n    First find out how many are taken by both Sakura and Theo: \n     Total number of eggs found by them = 7 + 21\n = 28\n\n   Subtracting those two amounts (Sakura & Theo) from the total amount that Kayla hid, leaves:\n   Amount left after they took their share    = Total hidden - Taken\n = 84-28 \n =56 \n\n   A quarter of this remaining egg count is:  \n   Quarter taken by Noah                  = 1/4 * 56\n = 14\n\n5. Finally, we find the number of eggs still left in the yard after all the kids have collected their share:\n   Eggs hidden now                      = Total amount - Taken \n =84- (28+14)\n =42 \n\nAnswer: The final answer is $\\boxed{42}$.",

Fatima finds thrice as many eggs as Sanjay, which means she finds 3 * 4 = 12 eggs.\n4. Andre finds 2 less than Fatima's count, so he finds 12 - 2 = 10 eggs.\n5. Camila finds half of the number of eggs found by Andre, meaning she finds (1/2) * 10 = 5 eggs.\n\n6. Now we need to find out how many eggs are left in total after Sanjay, Fatima, Andre, and Camila have collected their shares:\n   - Total shared so far: 4 + 12 + 10 + 5 = 31\n   - Eggs hidden originally: 48\n\n7.

We are given the following information:\n- She can peel 6 carrots per minute.\n- It takes her 11 minutes to saute 45 carrots.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many sets of 45 carrots she needs to make in order to have at least 90 carrots. This is calculated by dividing the total number of carrots (90) by the number of carrots in each set (45).\nNumber of sets = Total carrots / Carrots per set\n= 90 / 45\n= 2\n\nSince we know that it takes her 11 minutes to saute one set, she will need twice as long for two sets. Therefore:\nTime taken to peel and saute 90 carrots = Time taken to make first set + Time taken to make second set\n- Since Sophia can peel 6 carrots per minute (constant rate), the time it takes her to peel all 90 carrots is simply: \nTime taken to peel 90 carrots = Total number of carrots / Number of carrots peeled per minute.\n= 90/6  \n= 15 minutes.\n\nHowever, as we know she also needs to saute these carrots and has already made two sets. Therefore the total time for both peeling (which is constant) and cooking would be: \nTotal Time = 11 + 2 * 11\nWe will only use this step to calculate how long it takes her to peel, as we have a simpler calculation available.\nTime taken to make first set of sauteed carrots = Carrots per set / Rate at which she can sauté\n= 45/6 \nNow that we know the time for both peeling and cooking combined (we now see this is unnecessary), let's look only at her ability to peel.

First, we need to round the prices of each type of vegetable to the nearest dollar.\n   - The price of tulips is €3.24, which rounds up to $3.25 (since 0.24 < 0.50).\n   - The price of orchids is €3.57, which remains unchanged at $3.57 (since it's closer to $4 than $1 when rounded down or up respectively, but in this case the .5 rounds to a dollar as well)\n   - However there is an issue with Roses since 6.40 is higher than one and will round up so that is €6.40 which becomes $7.\n   \n2. Now we multiply each type of vegetable's price by its quantity sold:\n   - For tulips: 12 * $3.25 = $39\n   - For orchids: 30 * $3.57 = $107.10 (rounding up to the nearest dollar will be done at final calculation)\n   - For roses: 35 * $7 = $245\n\n3. At this point we need to round each of those values for consistency with Arash's decision:\n    To do that, let us first calculate them in decimal format and then use rounding rules\n      - tulips rounded is already calculated as $39.\n        For orchids: 107.10 becomes $107 when you would have done the same calculation in step 2 but without looking at our previous work on roses for consistency \n          However, we need to round this up since Arash's rule will be applied later and so it actually should become $108 (for example if he sold 30 orchids that were only slightly under €3.50, they would still sell as €4 per bunch)\n      - For roses: It was already calculated at $245\n\nStep by step we have rounded the values in accordance with Arash's rule:\n   The amount of money made from selling each type will now be summed.\n \nAnswer: The final answer is 392.",

First, we need to round the prices of each plant type to the nearest dollar.\n   - The price of orchids ($1.59) rounded to the nearest dollar is $2 per bundle.\n   - The price of daisies ($3.05) rounded to the nearest dollar is already a whole number and remains at $3 per bundle.\n   - However, we should note that for accuracy in calculation, especially when dealing with fractions less than 1, it's often more precise to round after multiplication rather than before.\n\n2. Calculate the total amount made from selling each type of plant by rounding their respective prices:\n   - For orchids: Each sale is $2 per bundle and Andre sells 10 bundles.\n     Total for Orchids = Number of Bundles * Price Per Bundle\n                      = 10 * $2\n                      = $20\n\n   - For daisies: Each sale is already at the rounded price, so:\n     Total for Daisies = Number of Bundles * Rounded Price per Bundle\n                      = 28 * $3\n                      = $84\n\n   - For lilies: Similarly,\n     Total for Lilies = Number of Bundles * Rounded Price Per Bundle\n                    = 39 * $5 (as we need to round the original price first)\n                    First, let's find how many dollars are in $5.78 and then round.\n                    $5.78 has .78 as its decimal part which is less than 1 so it rounds down.\n     Rounded Price for Lilies = $5\n     Total for Lilies = Number of Bundles * Rounded Price per Bundle\n                     = 39 * $5 (As we determined that the original price rounded to nearest dollar will be $5)\n                     = $195\n\n3.

    "logic_problem": {
      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\nTo find out how much Kai will make, we first need to calculate the total amount he earns from each type of flower.\n\n1. Orchids: The price per basket is ¥1.26 and there are 15 baskets sold.\n   Price for orchid = Number of orchid baskets * Price per orchid\n   Price for orchid ≈ (15) * 1.26 \n   Since the instruction to round prices to the nearest dollar, we'll first calculate the exact amount then apply this rule later on.\n\n2. Roses: The price per basket is ¥2.79 and there are also 15 baskets sold.\n   Price for rose = Number of rose baskets * Price per rose\n   Price for rose ≈ (15) * 2.79\n\n3. Lilies: The price per basket is ¥6.4 and there are 39 baskets sold.\n   Price for lily = Number of lily baskets * Price per lily \n   Price for lily ≈ (39) * 6.4 \n\nNow let's calculate the exact prices first:\nPrice for orchid ≈ (15) * 1.26\n   Price for orchid ≈ ¥18.90\n\nSince we need to round this price, it becomes approximately ¥19.\n\nPrice for rose = (15) * 2.79 \n   Price for rose ≈ ¥41.85 \n\nAgain since the instruction is about rounding prices per basket: and not the amount earned from each sale in total,\nwe can just approximate as follows - we will do that later when summing all up.\n\n\nPrice for lily ≈ (39) * 6.4\n   Price for lily = ¥251.60\n\nNow let's round these values to the nearest dollar:\n- For Orchids: Rounded price is already done above, it becomes approximately ¥19.\n\n- Since Roses and Lilies' original prices weren't rounded yet - we will apply this rule now.\n   We'll keep in mind that if a number ends with .5 or more than 0.50 then the final digit has to be rounded up (e.g: $2.49 would become $3).\n\nPrice for rose ≈ ¥41.85, rounding price becomes approximately ¥42.\n\n- Similarly \n    Price for lily = ¥251.60 and after applying round off rule it remains as is - we are using 'as' here because 6 has no .5 or anything in its decimal places so won't be changed\n\n\nNow let's sum all the rounded prices:\nTotal amount earned ≈ (Orchid price) + (Rose price) + (Lily price)\n   Total amount earned = ¥19 + ¥42+¥251.60\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 312.6",

To find out how many letters are in everything she has already written, we add the total number of alphabets to two-fourths:\n    However since her last 'full' set includes all that was previously done and then more it's effectively an addition for the entire amount\n   So total is: 130 +13 = 143\n\n5. Now re-writing everything she has already written means writing this sum again.\nSo, the final number of letters Beatriz wrote in total is:\n   2 * 143 \n\nAnswer: The final answer is 286",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n1. Jasmine first writes the full hiragana 9 times, so we need to calculate how many letters this is in total.\n2. There are 48 letters in the hiragana script. Writing it nine times would be multiplying 48 by 9 (since each time she writes all the letters).\n   This equals: 9 * 48 = 432\n3. Next, Jasmine writes four-sixths of the full hiragana once.\n   First we need to find what 'four-sixths' means in terms of a fraction:\n   Four is just 4/1 and sixhs are 6/1 so \n    (Four-Sixth) = ((4 / 1) - (6/1))\n     To do that, first get common denominator: ((4*1)-(6 *1))/1\n      That's equal to:\n       (((4)*1)/1)-((6)*1)/1)\n        So it is \n         ((-2)/1) which simplifies further into just -2/1\n   This means that Jasmine writes 48 letters multiplied by (-2 /1). Note the negative sign in front of this.\n    Multiply these two values together to get: (48 *(-2)) = -96\n4. After writing four-sixths, she re-writes everything so we add both parts back into one:\n   Write all full scripts 9 times and subtract out what was written before then write the remaining fraction portion once \n      Total letters equals ((First nine) + (- second sixhs)). So that's (432-96)+96\n        That is equal to: (336+96)\n         And finally we get a total of:\n          432",

Finally, we calculate the amount of ore that can be mined by 20 goblins with diamond pickaxes.\n   Since there are 20 such goblins.\n\nOre mined by 20 goblins in a month (with diamond pickaxe) = 20 * 364\n = 7280 kgs \n\nAnswer: The final answer is 7280.",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to find out how many kgs of ore 20 trolls can mine with a nickel pickaxe in one day.\n\nSince one troll with bare hands mines 5 kg/day and two times as much (10 kg) is mined with the nickel pickaxe, let's assume it takes x days for all 20 trolls to reach this rate. This means that together they already have some ore, which we don't know yet, but in 'x' more days at a higher speed.\n\nTo simplify our calculation, let's calculate their combined daily mining capacity with the nickel pickaxe first: \n   (1 troll * 10 kg/day) + ... + (19 trolls * 10 kg/day)\n\nSince there are only 20 trolls and each can mine twice as much ore than one with bare hands:\n(5*2)^19 = (10^19) kgs.\n\nWe'll call the number of days required for them to reach this rate 'x'. \n\nNow, we have: \n   x * 10 kg/day + remaining amount\n\nBut since each troll can mine at a different time and speed but has equal pickaxes:\nLet's simplify it. Assume they already had some ore in their hands before.\n\nSo let's find out how many kgs of ore the trolls with nickel axes can produce together per day: \n   (5*2)^19 = 10^19 \n\nThe amount required for one month is thus found by multiplying this number:\n10^19 * 29 days\n\nHowever, we don't know yet if there's any remaining amount in their hands already. This will be calculated below.\n\nStep 3: We now have to figure out how much ore the trolls can mine with titanium pickaxes.\nSince a troll mines two times as much (2*10=20 kgs) using nickel and they use an additional 70% more:\n   -0.7 * 10 kg = -7 \nNow, add it up for all 20 of them: \n    +20(19-1)\nSince '19' trolls have already reached the level where we don't know how long would be required to reach this amount and they are using titanium pickaxes:\n   We can simplify our calculation by calling this new rate 'r'. Then, since it takes x days for them all together with a nickel axe at their current speed of mining ore. The number of kgs that 19 trolls have mined in the meanwhile is thus found as follows: \n(10 * (20-1) ) + remaining amount \n\nBut again this equals to:\n    r - 0.7*5\n\nSince each troll mines two times more with titanium than nickel axes, we can now replace 'r' using an equation above where all 19 trolls would be mining at the rate of a single troll but in one month.\n\nNow that's: \n   x * (2^20)\nSo it will take them:\n    -x*(10/9)\n\nTo reach their new level. We just need to calculate how much ore they have already mined using nickel axes by this time:\n\n 19 trolls with titanium pickaxes, would then be equal to\n(5*2)^19 = (10^19) kgs\n\nNow let's find out the amount of days needed for them all together at their new speed:\n   - x * (10/9)\n\nThe number of ore left when they are using nickel axes is \n 20x*(1-0.7)\nAnd this should be equal to\n(5*2)^19 \n\nStep 4: Solve the equation above.\n\nNow we need to calculate 'x' which represents days needed for them all together with a nickel pickaxe at their current speed of mining ore.\nThe amount required for one month is thus found by multiplying this number:\n10^19 * 29 days\n\nThis equals (5*2)^20\nWe can solve the equation above now.\n\n(1 -0.7)\n   = 0.3\n\n\nNow calculate 'x'\n    x*(9/10) \n         = [(5*2)^19]/[20]\n        = [10^19] /[(20)]\n          = (10 ^18)/2 \n\nSo we have:\n  The number of ore left when they are using nickel axes is\n     -x * 0.3\n\n   x*(9/10) \n         = [(5*2)^19]/[20]\n        = [10^19] /[(20)]\n          = (10 ^18)/2 \n\nSo we have:\n(1- 0.7)\n    = 0.3\n\n\nNow calculate 'x'\n     - x * 0.3\n       =(9/10)* [(5*2)^19]/[20]\n         = [10^19] /[(2)]\n           = (10 ^18)/4 \n\nStep 5: \nFind out how many ore the trolls can mine with titanium pickaxes.\n\n",

Now, we find out how much ore is mined using this nickel pickaxe in one day.\n   It's equal to 1 miner times the amount he mines per day: (10/3) * 1 = 10/3 pounds of ore per miner and a nickel pickaxe per day.\n\n4.

First, we need to find the amount of water in each type of drink separately.\n   - The apple drink is 2/3 water and has a total volume of 18 liters.\n     Water in Apple Drink = (2/3) * 18\n                         = (2 * 18)/3\n                         = 36/3\n                         = 12\n\n   - The lemon drink is 4/5 water and has a total volume of 30 liters.\n     Water in Lemon Drink = (4/5) * 30\n                           = (4 * 30)/5\n                           = 120/5\n                           = 24\n\n\n2. Next, we need to find the amount of water after spilling some from the apple drink and adding it to the lemon drink.\n   - Since we spilled 3 liters of the apple drink, which is also water, let's calculate how much total volume will remain when we add both drinks together:\n     Total Volume = (18-3) + 30\n                  = 15 + 30\n                  = 45\n\n   As given in the question: The remaining total volume after adding and spilling some of it is 45 liters.\n\n\n3.

The correct thought is we should have not added any to begin with but kept track of each separately: \nSince there's a mix-up here let us directly calculate by looking at both in separate and then just combine as if adding were the only action taken on total mixture:\n-  Total Water = (2/3)*18 +(4/5) *30  \n               -  Spilled amount is pure water of Apple drink\n              To correctly solve: We must remove this spilled part to see remaining in each and then add.\n\nStep one calculate actual amount before spill for both drinks combined without any addition:\n- First Drink Volume (water content): \n   Total Water from first Drink = (2/3)*18  \n                               = 36 / 3\n                               =12\n\n- Second drink has its water as a part of whole which is already calculated in terms volume and hence does not need recalculation.\n\n\nTo finally get the answer, we combine both drinks' volumes without any addition to begin with:\n   Volume Before Spill = First Drink +Second drink \n                        (volume of second drink remains unchanged here)\n                      Total Volume  before spill for calculation purposes=18+30\n                                -3 liters have been lost from apple.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 42.",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's calculate the amount of water in each drink:\n   - The peach drink is 4/6 or 2/3 water.\n   - Since we have 15 liters of it and 1 liter represents 1 unit of fraction,\n     the total units of this drink are: \n       (2/3) * 15 = 10\n\n    So, there's a total of 10 liters of water in the peach drink.\n\n   - The grape drink is 2/5 water.\n   - Since we have 20 liters of it and 1 liter represents 1 unit of fraction,\n     the total units of this drink are: \n       (2/5) * 20 = 8\n\n    So, there's a total of 8 liters of water in the grape drink.\n\n2. Next, let's calculate how much water we have initially:\n   Total initial amount of water is the sum of water from both drinks.\n   Initial water: 10 (from peach) + 8 (from grape) = 18\n\n3. Then, let's find out the actual total after spilling some of it. \n   Since we spill 6 liters and initially had a total of:\n     - Peach drink amount was reduced by adding more but since only water is spilled: The reduction in water from peach is (2/3) * 15 = 10\n   Then subtract this value to get actual remaining peach drink.\n    Actual remaining peach drink will be : \n      15-6=9\n\n     Now the total amount of liquid after spilling and adding more becomes:\n        - Grape:20 liters + Peach: 9 liter  (Now water is added while drinking) =29\n   Total initial amount was:10+8=18. Since we spill only peach drink so actual remaining from it will be: \n    - The reduction in water from peach after spilling and adding more will become:\n       Actual Remaining Water of Peach Drink: \n        2/3 * (9) =6 \n\n   So the total amount of liquid becomes\n      Grape drink is still 20 liters with a value of:8  \n     And now we have actual remaining water in it as well.

Now that we know there are 90 purple and 75 green cards combined.\n5. The problem states that orange cards equal the sum of both green and purple cards:\n   - So, to find the total number of orange cards: \n     75 + 90 = 165 (total number of orange cards)\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 265",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's find out the number of green cards. It is given that there are 60% more green cards than red cards.\n   Since we have 45 red cards, \n   We can calculate the extra number of green cards as follows:\n   Extra Green Cards = (60/100) * Red Cards\n                      = 0.6 * 45\n                      = 27\n\n2. Now that we know there are an additional 27 green cards beyond what would be equal to red, \n   To find out the total number of green cards,\n   We need to add these extra green cards with the base number of green cards.\n   Since it's mentioned in the problem that yellow cards have as many colors as a sum of red and green, let us first calculate this:\n   Red Cards + Green Cards = 45 (Red) + [Base Number of Green] \n                           + Extra Green Cards\n   But we don't know what is base number yet.\n   \n3. Let's call the total number of Green cards \"Total Green\"\n   Then Base Number of green will be Total Green - extra Green.\n\n4. Since Yellow Card = Red card + Green card, \n   We have already calculated this: 45 (Red) + [Base Number Of Green] \n\n5. Now let us express everything using one variable:\n    Let the base number of green cards be x\n    So total red is given as 45.\n    Total extra green will be = 0.6 * Red Cards \n                               = 27, since we already calculated it in step1.\n\n   We know that Yellow card + Green Card + Extra Green should also equal to 'x', therefore,\n    X = (Red cards) + [Base number of Green] \n\n5. Using variable x from above equation:\n    So our total green will be Base Number Of Green + extra \n   Total Green = 27 + x\n   We have now expressed both red and green in terms of one variable, 'x'.\n\n6. As per the problem statement,\n    Yellow cards are as many as Red Cards + Green Card.\n    Hence we can write:\n     X = (Red) + [Green]\n      In equation form \n       Total Green  - extra   x\n        =   (45 red)\n             (Base green)\n\n7. Substitute values from above step in the formula for total yellow cards,\n    Therefore Yellow Cards will be: \n              Total Red Card + Extra Green     Base Number of Green \n\n8. So now that we know all these, let us write everything down:\n  Let x = base number\n   Since there is extra green beyond this 'x',\n        (Total Green) - x  \n       We already calculated it in step1 as: \n               Total Yellow Card + Extra Green     Base Number of Green \n\n9. Now that we know the relationship between all variables,\n    So let's express everything using only one variable:\n   Let us call base green number 'x'\n   Red = 45, extra green will be (60/100)*Red\n         We have calculated this already in step1 as: \n           Extra Green Card is equal to 0.6*red card \n\n10. Therefore Total Yellow Cards can now also be represented using only variable x,\n    As we know total yellow cards are sum of red and green.\n   Hence:\n        Yellow Card = (45 Red) + [x Base number]\n\n11. Now since there's extra Green beyond this 'base' value, let us rewrite the equation as: \n     Total green - Extra green  \n         We have already calculated it in step1\n    Therefore total yellow will be same if we express everything using only one variable x:\n      (Base Number of Green) + (Extra Green Card)\n          =   45 Red card \n\n12. Substituting values for extra green and base number,\n     Total Yellow Cards - Extra Green  \n         We have calculated it already as: \n        X will equal to red, plus extra green\n\n13. Therefore we can say:\n      x Base + (60/100)*Red Card\n          =   45 Red card \n\n14. Now since there's an additional green beyond this base value,\n    So let us rewrite equation for yellow cards using one variable 'x'\n     Total Yellow Cards - Extra Green \n         We have calculated it already as:  \n      X will equal to red, plus extra green\n     Therefore total number of yellow card can now be written in terms of only variable x:\n        0.6 * Red Card + Base Number of Green \n\n15. Substituting values for base and extra,\n    Total Yellow Cards - Extra Green = (60/100)*Red \n      We have calculated this as:  \n       X will equal to red, plus extra green\n     Therefore total number of yellow card can now be written in terms of only variable x:\n         0.6 * Red Card + Base Number of Green \n\n16.

Since hiring an accountant will save her 6 fewer hours, we have x = (x + 6) - 6.\n3. However, this equation doesn't make sense as it would always be true for any value of x. So let's rephrase our problem: \n   - If Kayla does the taxes herself, she'll lose '6' hours and €70/hour in income.\n   - The accountant charges €79 per hour.\n\nWe can assume that if Kayla hires an accountant to do her taxes, then instead of losing 6 hours at a rate of €70/hour (€420 loss), it would be like not doing anything for those 'x' lost hours and still working on the remaining work. \n\n4. The difference between what she'd lose by doing taxes herself (6 * 70) is compared to the accountant's charge per hour.\n   So, we need to find out how many extra euros Kayla would get if an accountant did her tax return.\n\nThe equation for this problem becomes:\n79x - 420 = y\n\nwhere 'y' is what she gains by hiring someone. \n\n5. However since we don't know the total number of hours or amount of work, let's rephrase our original question and figure out how many more euros Kayla will make if an accountant does her tax return compared to doing it herself.\n\n   - If Kayla loses 6 * €70 = €420 per hour by not using that extra time on taxes (since she'd have lost those hours), then the difference between what happens when someone else is hired would be: \n     (€79/hour) - (€70/ hour) for each of those 'x' missing hours.\n   Since we don't know how many total hours Kayla can do, let's instead just compare her gain per lost hour.\n\n6. Her potential income loss per hour will then decrease by €9 when hiring someone to calculate the taxes:\n- €420 / 6 = €70/hour\n- Decrease of €9 in each hour she does not have for tax work (i.e. lose these extra 'x' hours)\n\n7. To find out how much more money Kayla will make if an accountant calculates her return instead, we calculate the difference between what happens when someone else is hired compared to doing it herself:\n- The hourly income loss from lost time: €70/hour * 6 = €420.\n- Decrease in each hour (when hiring): -€9\n   Now add this up and see how many more euros Kayla will make per \"hour\" of work when she hires the accountant.\n\n8. Since we want to find out what happens for 'x' hours instead, let's figure that out:\n  The decrease from lost time: €70 * (6 / x)\n- When hired someone would lose only these many fewer euros by losing those extra hours.\n   We now get our gain per \"hour\":\n    - €420 + €9x\n\nWe don't actually need to know the 'total' number of hours she works because we are looking at a change in income from one scenario (doing taxes herself) to another (hiring someone else). The problem asks how much more money Kayla will make if an accountant does her tax return compared to doing it herself.\n\n9. Now let's put our equation into the original format: \n   - €420 + 6 * €9 = y\n\n10.

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. Let's assume Olga would have done x hours of part-time work if she did her taxes herself.\n2. Since the tax consultant charges ¥64 per hour, and she'll do 10 fewer hours of part-time work, we can set up an equation to represent the situation: \n   (x - 10) * ¥34 = (x - 10) * ¥64\n3. We know that doing her taxes herself will result in losing ¥34/hour for x-10 hours.\n4. The amount of money she loses by not working those hours is equal to the difference between what she would have earned at a higher rate and what she earns when paying the tax consultant.\n\nHowever, this equation was initially set up incorrectly because it equates both sides with (x - 10), which isn't relevant for solving our actual question. What we want instead is:\n   x * ¥34 = (x hours) * ¥64\n5. We can simplify that to find out how much money she will lose if doing taxes herself, and then subtract the amount of lost income from what would be gained by paying a consultant.\n6. This equation doesn't actually solve our original question but gives insight into calculating potential earnings. The key is instead finding x (hours worked without tax consultants) so that:\n   10 * ¥34 = (x - 10 hours work) * ¥64\n7. Solve for the amount of money she loses by not working those extra ten hours, given we don't actually know how many hours she would have been able to do.\n8. However our equation was still flawed; let's look at what happens if Olga hires a consultant and does x-10 more part-time jobs:\n   (x - 10) * ¥34 = income gained from doing fewer work by not being taxed, while \n   x hours of the same job yield: \n    (x) * ¥64\n9. Because she loses money when working less hours without taxes on that amount,\n10. The actual question simply asks us for what difference there will be between her earnings if hiring a consultant instead.\n11. Now we can set up an equation to find out how much more money Olga would have, using:\n    (x) * ¥64 -  (x-10)*¥34 \n12. Let's expand and simplify the expression: \n   x*64 -(x-10)*34\n13. Expand this by distributing terms on the right-hand side.\n14. The full expansion is then: \n      =64x-34(x-10)\n15. Use a FOIL method (multiply first, outer product term second... to finish expanding) for this last expression:\n    64x -34x +340\n16. Now that we have an expanded and simplified version of our original equation, the next step is to collect like terms by combining them.\n   =30 * x+ 340 \n17. Since what actually matters here isn't how many hours she worked (we're trying to figure out a difference), let's set this expression equal to some y:\n    Let y= amount of money gained if hiring the consultant\n18. To make things easier, we can plug in our 'x' value as 10 since it cancels when simplified.\n19. We then find that y is actually just: \n   = ¥30 * 10 +¥340 \n     =¥370\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 370",

If she does it herself, she'll be able to work 11 fewer hours.\n2. So, we can write an equation based on this information: x - 11 = number of hours worked by bookkeeper\n3. We know that the bookkeeper charges €98/hour and Aisha loses €62/hour if she does it herself. Therefore, her lost income is 11 * €62.\n4. The difference between what she would have made (if hired a bookkeeper) and what she will make by doing taxes herself can be expressed as:\n   x - hours worked by the bookkeeper = number of euros Aisha loses if hiring a bookkeeper \n5. Since we don't know 'x', let's try to express her lost income in terms of hours. Her lost income is 11 * €62, which equals: 682€\n6. Now we can write an equation using this information:\n   x - (hours worked by the bookkeeper) = 682\n7. But since we don't know 'x', let's use a different approach to solve for hours that Aisha would have lost if she hires a bookkeeper.\n8. Since Aisha will lose €62/hour, and the difference in income is equal to her hourly loss times number of hours worked by the bookkeeper (11), \n   then we can directly express this as:\n    682 = 98 * x - 6230\n9.

Since 'x' was found above to equal 70.8, let's plug it into our new equation:\n      €6230=€(70.8 +11)*€98\n       ->   €6230 =$7803 \n\nStep by step reasoning is complete.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is €1569.",

Let's denote that as 'x'. \n\nSo, \nMissed Income for x hours of work is:\n$53*x\n\nStep 2: Calculate the lost income due to less freelance time.\nLost income = $53*(Hours - 9)\n\nBut we don't know how many hours she has available or will spend on taxes. We need another equation.\n\nWe are also given that an accountant charges $84 per hour and costs money for their services, which is not specified in this problem but let's assume it can be ignored since the main comparison should focus solely on income lost vs what Sofia could potentially gain from hiring someone else to do her tax work. The actual cost of the service doesn't matter here.\n\nStep 3: Calculate how much she would earn by doing her own taxes for x hours and compare that with the potential earnings if an accountant was hired.\nPotential Income = $84 * (Hours - 9)\n\nHowever, we don't have 'x' which represents total available time or what Sofia will be able to spend on freelancing after working on taxes. \n\nTo address this problem without assuming more information than given:\nIf she works for x hours at her own rate of $53 per hour and loses those same 9 hours due to doing taxes, then the equation should actually represent how much less income is earned compared to what would be possible if someone else were hired.\n\nFor simplicity in explanation: \nThe lost income from doing tax work herself minus the potential earnings with an accountant can help solve this problem. But without specific numbers for 'Hours' or more information about available hours, a direct calculation isn't feasible using only given data.\n\n\nHowever since we must calculate it according to the format you specified let's consider another angle - Sofia will be able to do 9 fewer hours of freelance work because she'll spend that time doing her taxes. If this represents lost income for x number of hours then:\n \nLost Income from Doing Taxes = $53 * (Hours Spent on Tax Work)\n\n\nIf we compare potential earnings with an accountant ($84/hour) and the actual hourly wage when working, assuming 'x' is unknown but Hours spent at own rate will be less by 9 due to tax work: \n\nPotential Earnings - Actual Income Lost from Doing Taxes \n= $84 * (Hours Available for Work)\n- $53 * x\n\n\nHowever we are not given enough info on the amount of hours she has available. Let's simplify our approach.\n\n\nIf Sofia does her taxes herself and loses 9 fewer hours, then it should directly relate to lost income due to this time taken away from other work - \n\nLost Income Due To Taxes = $53 * (Hours Spent Doing Tax Work)\n\n\nHowever since we do not have 'x' value or Hours spent doing tax work. We can say that if Sofia had 9 fewer hours for freelance she'd lose \n$53 per hour, but without knowing how many total hours are available - it's hard to compute this accurately.\n\n\nBut assuming a scenario where the lost income due to taxes is subtracted from potential earnings with an accountant ($84 * (Hours Available)):\n\nIf we know that $84/hour and Sofia loses 9 fewer hours then let’s simplify:\nLost Income Due To Taxes = Missed Hourly Wage Lost\n\n\nWe need another equation. We should assume that she works x number of hours but only spends those few more hours on tax work instead of doing her normal job at a certain rate per hour.\n\nStep by step reasoning for this: \nLet's denote 'x' as the total available time Sofia has to do freelance, and let 'Hours Spent Doing Tax Work be (hours spent doing taxes) = x - 9\n\n\nIf she was able to work x number of hours but only did one fewer due to tax work then Lost Income from Doing Taxes would equal Missed Hourly Wage Lost times Hours Available for Freelance minus those lost freelance hours:\n= $53 * ((Hours Spent on Tax Work))\n\n\nWe can now equate this with potential earnings - actual income: \n\nPotential Earnings (With Accountant) = Actual Income\n\nSince we know that an accountant charges more but do not have the exact amount of time or available 'x' for Hours worked then without assuming additional information:\nLost Income Due To Taxes \n= Missed Hourly Wage Lost * Less Work Done\n\n\nLet’s assume potential earnings - lost income from doing taxes equals $84 per hour times total hours minus those",

We can now solve:\n\nOriginal Work Hours: x + 7 \nNew Advisor's Pay Rate: €57(x -1)\n\nThe equation will then look something like:\n(195 * x) = ((x+7)*-57)\nExpanding the right side of that we get\n(195*x)= (-57*(x)+(-399))\n\nNow let's solve for 'x'\nSimplifying gives us \n(195*x)=( -57(x)- 399)\n\nLet's move terms around:\n (195 + 57) * x = 357 - 399\n\nThe left-hand side simplifies to: \n192 * x =-42.\n\nDividing by 192 on both sides we get:\n\nx=-42/192 \n\nThis isn't useful in this case, though. We can simply take a different approach using algebra without making that step (there's actually no need). The equation should look something like:\n(195*x) +57*7 = ( x+7)*-57\n\nLet's solve it correctly:\n\nExpanding gives us \n(195 *x)+ 399=-57*(x)+ -399\nAdding both sides together, then subtracting the same amount on each side: \n\n(195+x)-57=0  \n\nWe can rearrange this equation to isolate 'x' by adding 57 and then dividing:\n (192 + x) /1 = 0\n\nTo get rid of that denominator we'll multiply through by a number such as one, or more simply -1. \n-1 * (192+x)= -57 \n\nExpanding the left side gives us: \n -192-x=-57\nNow let's isolate 'x':  \n\nAdding +192 to both sides and then dividing:\n   x = 135\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 135.",

Since it takes her 21 minutes per puzzle, \nTime for jigsaw puzzles = Number of jigsaw puzzles * Time per puzzle\n= 5 * 21\n= 105\n\nNext, we'll find out how much she spends on chess puzzles. It takes her 18 minutes to finish a single chess puzzle,\nSo the total time spent solving chess puzzles is:\nTotal Chess Puzzles = Number of chess puzzles * Time for one chess puzzle\n= 4 * 18 (since it's per chess, use just 'per')\nHowever, since we need to know how much she spends in minutes and all calculations must be expressed as multiples or single numbers - \nTime spent on a chess is already given.\nTherefore,\n Total Chess Puzzles = Number of chess puzzles * Time for one chess puzzle\n= 4 * 18 (since it's per)\n To maintain consistency with 'minutes', we have to calculate the time Ava spends playing these games, thus multiply by 'per'\nTotal Chess Puzzles in minutes = Number of chess puzzles * Minutes per chess \n= 4* 18\n\nNow that we know she spent a certain amount on jigsaw and another amount on chess - add them together.\nTo find total time:\nTime for Jigsaws + Time for Chess\nSo Total Time Spent Playing Games = (5)*21 minutes+ (4)*(18) \n\nStep by step calculation of above equation,\n=105+(4*18)\nNow multiply 4 with 'per' we can do this as follows: \n(4)(minutes per chess puzzle)=4 * 18 minutes\nSince all calculations should be single numbers - express in terms of multiplication, then calculate. Thus:\nTime spent playing games = (5)21 + [(4)(18)]\n=105+(72)\nTherefore,\n Time for Jigsaws + Chess Puzzles \nTotal time spent on the game played over the weekend: 177 minutes.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 177.",

Now, we know the carpenter gets paid ¥55 every day.\nTo find out how much he earns in a year, multiply his daily pay by the total number of working days:\nTotal annual earnings = Daily pay/day * Total number of working days/year\n= ¥55/day * 240 days/year\n= ¥13,200/year\n\nAnswer: The final answer is ¥13,200.",

Since there are approximately 52 weeks in a year (accounting for leap years), let's first find out how many working days he has in a year:\n\nNumber of working days per month = Number of working days per week * Number of weeks per month\n= 4 days/week * 3 weeks/month\n= 12 days/month\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of working months and then multiply it by the number of working days per month:\n \nTotal number of working months in a year = Total weeks in a year / Weeks worked per month\n= 52 weeks/year ÷ 3 weeks/month\n= 17.33 (round down to 17 since we can't have half a month)\n\nHowever, it would be better if I took the actual whole week into account here.\n\nNumber of working days per month = Number of working days per week * Weeks worked in that month\n\nSince there are only two possible scenarios for weeks in a year - either 52 or 53:\n\n1) If he works all 52 weeks, then\n   Total number of working months in a year is already given as 17.33 which can be simplified to (52/3).\n2) Or if the painter worked more than the standard 4 days and less than his maximum possible work.\n\nFor simplicity, let's just calculate with \"52\" weeks:\n\nTotal number of working days per month = Number of working days per week * Weeks worked in that month\n= 4 days/week \n\nNow,\n \nNumber of months he would be getting paid for is equal to (total no. of days /days per month) i.e.\n\nIf he works all the given weeks - then total number of months will indeed be =52 weeks/year ÷3.\n \nSo, let's take \"17\" as his working period in a year. Now we can multiply that with 4 and get:\n\nTotal Working Days = Total Months * Number of days worked per week\n= (total no. of months) * number of day worked per month\n \nNow,\nThe daily wage is given to be ₣65.\n\nSo, the total earnings for the painter will be:\n \nEarnings in a year = Daily Wage * Total working days\n= 65 ₣/day * ((52 weeks/year ÷3 weeks/month )* (4 days/week))\n= 65₣/day*(52/3)*4\n= 65 * (13.33) * 4 \n≈65 *53.32 ≈ 3449\n\nHowever, I need to clarify this answer further.\n\nGiven that he works for 4 days every week and the month is assumed as a 'normal' working period with only three weeks of work per month - since there are indeed other possible scenarios too like if he worked more than his maximum weekly limit.",

Now, we can calculate the total amount of feed required by multiplying the number of goats (34) with their respective daily requirement:\n    Total feed needed for goats = Number of goats * Feed per goat\n = 34 * 19\n = 646 kilograms\n4. To get the final answer, let's also find out how much feed is required by all donkeys and add it to the amount calculated in step 3.\n   The number of donkey feed needed: Number of donkeys * Feed per donkey \n = 39 * 10 \n = 390 kilograms\n5. Finally, we'll sum up both amounts:\n    Total feed needed for livestock = Amount required by goats + Amount required by donkeys\n = 646 + 390\n = 1036 kilograms\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 1036.",

Since there are two people, the total number of letters sent per week by Pavel's remaining friends is:\n   - Letters per week: 2 * (3 letters/week/person) = 6 letters/week\n   - Total pages per letter: Each page takes up 14 minutes to write, and each friend sends 5-page-long letters.\n     So the time it takes for one person to send a message is:\n       - Time taken by sender of an email (per week): Since there are two people writing at once,\n         we should assume that both friends respond in kind. Therefore, Pavel receives total number of pages written per week as: \n           2 * 3 letters/week/person = 6 pages/week\n     So the time taken by sender of a page (per letter) is:\n       - Time for sending one message: 5 pages/message * (14 minutes/page)\n         - This will be equal to: 70 minutes per week.\n   Since there are two people writing at once,\n   so total number of emails sent in a week is\n     - Total time taken by sender of messages = \n       6 letters/week/person = 2 persons sending email and each person takes the same amount of time to send message. \n      Therefore, the equation becomes:\n        (70 minutes/page) * pages written per week / total number of people writing a page at once\n          - Since there are two persons,\n            This is equal to: 6 letters/week/person = 2 persons sending email and each person takes the same amount of time.\n           Therefore, it will be:\n             Time taken by sender of messages in minutes per week / (3 pages/message) * (5 message/page)\n          - Now let's find how many total number of emails are sent a week.

Therefore, we multiply this with:\n            The value obtained from above equation 210/6 which is equal to: 35.\n        This will be equal to:\n           Time taken by sender for sending all messages * total number of weeks in a year / (3 pages/message)\n          - We know that since Pavel responds in kind, and there are two people writing at once,\n            Therefore the equation becomes\n             ((70 minutes/page) * 6 pages/week)/2 people \n         Which is equal to: 210.

Comet Hale-Bopp orbits the sun every 90 years, which means that after 90 years from Theo's father's first sighting of the comet (when he was 47), the same cycle repeats.\n2. The time gap between the two sightings for both families is 90 years since they orbit at the same rate around the Sun.\n3. Since Theo saw the Comet when his age doubled compared to his dad, we can set up an equation: \n   Let 'x' be the number of years after Theo's father first sees the comet that he also sees it (i.e., x = 90). We are given:\n     - The time passed from his father seeing the Comet is not necessary for calculation as both will have seen it in the same cycle, which we already considered with 'x'.\n   And since \n    Theo's age when saw the comet a second time is two times that of his dad at first sighting: 2 * (47) = x\n4. Now solving this equation to find value for 'x', which represents years after his father's first sighting.\n      - So, we have:\n          94 = 2(47)\n           or,\n            x = 94 \n5. However looking at the question it says that Theo saw comet when he was two times age of dad who saw him a second time. Hence 'x' is not correct here but lets take years after his first sighting: let's say year difference between both sightings for this case, then we can denote (d) as number of years and now the equation will become:\n   Theo’s Age = 47 + d\n    And it was given that when he saw a second time,\n     - His age is twice that at his dad first sighting: \n         So if 'T' denotes theo's age then we have, T = x *2 (here as per the condition of problem)\n        Now putting value of 'x'\n            47 + d   =    94\n             or,\n\n               The difference between two sightings can be calculated in another way also by using a formula for this case. Where time gap is equal to years after first sighting of comet.\n                (Years After First Sighting) = Years Between Two Sightings \n                 So as per problem we are given that both will see the same thing i.e, comet and their cycle duration is 90 year so 'x' should be in terms of years between two sightings for a time gap at which theo also saw it. Therefore\n                  x - d   =    47\n                   or,\n                     (Years After First Sighting) + difference Years Between Two Sightings = Total Cycle Time \n                    Now putting value of x, we have:  \n                      (94 )+d=90 \n                       So the above equation holds true for this problem and 'x' can be discarded in favor of d to calculate years after first sighting as time gap between two sightings.  Since both are seeing same thing so if one sees it then other also will see.\n\n6. Calculating difference, i.e., 'd': \n                  Now putting values we get:\n                      (94) + d =90\n                    - d =   90-94 \n                   So the value of difference is,\n                     d    =     -4 \n\n7. As per equation: T= x*2 , put the value in place of 'x'. We have, x was not correct here as explained above we are now calculating years after his first sighting i.e., time gap between two sightings\n                Now putting values:\n                   Theo’s Age (when saw comet a second time) = 94 *2 \n                    - Since theo's age when he also sees the Comet is twice of what it was at that point when dad first see him. Therefore we can calculate value for 'x' now as explained in step 4 and put d to find years after his father’s sighting.\n                     So Theo’s Age (when saw comet a second time) = x *2\n                    - But here 'T'=Theo's age at that point of time is equal to the difference i.e.,d . \n                          Therefore putting value, we get:\n                        T=   d    or,\n                           94*2=d    \n                   Now taking values: \n                            Theo’s Age (when saw comet a second time) = x *2\n                             - Here as per problem statement and explanation given in steps above. Since 'x' is not correct here.\n                              We can say that years after first sighting i.e.,time gap between two sightings will be equal to value of d calculated in step 6, because both are seeing same thing so if one see then other also sees\n                            Theo’s Age (when saw comet a second time) = x *2 \n                          - So putting values we get:  \n                                T=   x*2    where 'x' is years after first sighting i.e., difference",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. Let's denote Viktor's grandfather age when he saw the Comet as x years old.\n2. Since Viktor was three times his grandfather's age when he saw the comet for a second time, and we know that Viktor is 32 + 75 = 107 (the number of years since then), Viktor's first time seeing the Comet can be calculated by:\n   Let y denote Viktor's age at his first sighting. Then,\n       y - x * 3 = 107\n4. We also have a relation from step 1 that represents how old Viktor was when he saw it for a second time, which is given in problem statement.\n   The equation can be written as:\n     (x + years) * 2 = age at the sighting of comet \n    Given Viktor's grandfathers' seen the Comet x year ago. So\n       => 3*(32+x)=y \n5. Now let's substitute y from above into our first equation, we will get,\n   => 107- (x*3)  = 96 + X which means: 11 -X=x * 3  \n6. From this new relation between x and the years that have passed since Viktor saw it for a second time , now we solve to find out what is value of unknown variable 'X'.\n   => X= (11- 4x)/1 =11-(33/2)=23 \n7. Now, substitute all our found variables back into equation from step two.\n    So the age at which Viktor first saw a comet can be written as\n       => y - x *3=107  \n     Substituting X in above equations we get: (32+23)-x*3 = 107 \n      This simplifies to :55-x*3=107 \n\n8. Now solve equation from step seven and find Viktor age at the first sighting of comet.\n   =>-2*x =52\n    The solution is x = -26\n\nSince we can't have negative ages, this indicates a problem in our prior assumption about Viktor's grandfather's age when he saw the Comet for the second time.\n\nHowever let us try another way:\nLet y denote Viktor's age at his first sighting. Then,\n   =>y-32= 3*(x +75) \n9. Now substitute x from step one into equation from above and find out what is value of unknown variable 'X'.\n    So the age at which Viktor first saw a comet can be written as\n       => y - 32 = 3 * ( (-26 )+75 )\n      This simplifies to :y=187-78 \n\n10. Now solve for y.\n   Since, we know that:\n     => y = x + years \n    Given Viktor's grandfathers' seen the Comet x year ago and after this he saw it at 32 plus some number of years 'n'. So,\n       => y = ( -26)+ n+32\n11. Now simplify equation from step ten.\n   We get :y=6+n\n\n12. Since we know that Viktor's age when first seen the Comet is equal to \n     three times his grandfather was at second time sighting, so: 3*(x +n)= y   \n13. Substitute x and n in above equations\n    => 3 * ( (-26) + years ) = 187+years \n14. Now solve equation from step thirteen.\n   We get : -78=years \n\nAnswer: The final answer is $\\boxed{6}$",

Since his dad was 43 years old, we can set up an equation based on the information given.\n\n2. We know that Comet Halley orbits the sun every 80 years and Mateo saw it a second time after (some number of times) 80 years from when he saw it for the first time.\n   \n3. Since Mateo was two times his dad's age when he saw the comet again, we can say: x + some multiple of 80 = 2 * 43.\n\n4. We need to find 'x', which is the number of years after Comet Halley passed by and that makes this equation true.\n   \n5. Since Mateo was two times his dad's age when he saw it a second time, we know: x + some multiple of 80 = 2 * (43 + some other multiple of 80). In order to simplify the calculation let us use only one cycle which is 80 years.\n\n6. Now from equation step 3 in this case would be \n   - Let's try using n as a factor here, so that we can set up an easier formula: x+80n=2*43\n     or simply put:\n       x +80n =86\n\n7. In the next cycle of 80 years from when he saw it for first time Mateo will be (x + some other multiple of 80) years old, and we are told that this would make him two times his dad's age at that point in time.\n   \n   This can easily translate to:\n    - We need a second equation here: x+some another n *80 =2*(43+n*80)\n      or simply put\n        1. x +n*80=86 \n\n8. Now we have two equations and variables, so it's easy for us now.\n\n9. Let's solve this:\n   - First let's isolate the variable 'x' by subtracting n * 80 from both sides: \n    - Then we'll get an equation like x = some constant + another factor of 80\n       Now in terms of variables, here are our equations:\n\n     a) x+80n=86 \n\n        b) x+n*80=86\n\n10. To isolate the variable 'x' let's subtract both equations:\n   - Subtracting equation (a) from equation (b), we'll get  : \n    n *80 =0\n    Now solving this for 'n', it is clear that: \n        n must be equal to zero.\n    \n11. We can now substitute the value of 'n' back into one of our equations:\n   - Substituting x+n*80=86, and replacing n with 0 we get: \n       x = 86 \n\nStep by step reasoning is complete.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 86.",

Since he also goes to school for these additional hours on both Saturday and Sunday, the extra learning time is doubled.\n   So the total weekly extra learning time:\n   Total extra learning time in a week \n    = 2 * Extra learning time per day\n     = 2 * 270 minutes\n      = 540 minutes\n\n6. Now we can calculate his total weekly learning hours by adding up both class and extra learning times.\n   Gabriel's total weekly learning time \n   = Total class time + Total extra learning time in a week \n    = (540 minutes) + (540 minutes)\n     = 1080 minutes \n\n7. Finally, convert this to the desired unit 'hours', given there are 60 minutes in one hour:\n   The final answer is: $\\boxed{18}$",

Next, we need to convert these minutes into hours for accurate calculation:\n   Weekly hours spent on regular school time = 550 / 60 ≈ 9.17 hours\n   However, since he has extra classes of the same duration and spends more time learning over weekends:\n\n3. Calculate weekly additional class times in a week: \n   Theo goes to these two extra classes for 5 days (Monday through Friday) per week.\n   Additional minutes spent on weekend classes = 2 * 55 = 110\n   And this is just the minimum since he spends more time learning:\n   \n4. Convert total weekly additional class times into hours:\n   Since we're given that Theo also learns extra on Saturday and Sunday, for simplicity let's consider an increase of his regular school time (9.17) to account for weekend classes.\n   Additional minutes spent over weekends = 110 \n   And this is just the minimum since he spends more time learning.\n\n5. Total weekly hours = Regular class times + Extra Weekend Learning\n   Since we do not know exact additional minutes and are trying a simpler approach, let's assume that his regular school hour was multiplied by some factor.\n   \n6. Instead of doing complex calculations with fractions to account for weekend extra classes:\n   To simplify: \n   Assume total hours spent on learning is = ( Regular class time + Extra Weekend Learning Time ) * multiplier.\n\n7. For the sake of simplification, assume that 1/10 of his regular school week's minutes were used in Saturday and Sunday.\n   Since this equals to 110 additional minutes for each weekend: \n   Total additional minutes spent on weekends per year = (2 classes) * 55 minutes * number of weeks\n      Let x represent total class time including the extra ones:\n        So, x is calculated as follows,\n       let y be a multiplier used with regular school hours.\n         Multiply all by that value and use to calculate answer.\n\n8. Simplifying calculation: Assume he uses his full week for learning - This makes it easier because we know how much of each day (except weekends) gets spent in the class room:\n   Let x represent total weekly minutes spent on classes including weekend times\n    Assuming multiplier is used, 10 *55 = x * y \n       Now, add extra weekend time: 110.\n        Then convert into hours using a simpler formula for easier understanding\n\n9. We know he goes to his two additional daily classes every day except the weekends and spends an equal amount of time in them each:\n   Multiply total regular class minutes by factor that accounts for his increased learning on weekdays.\n\n10. Finally, we calculate 1/10 extra times per week using given data.\n    Now assume there's some constant value 'a' added to account for weekend extra learning \n      Since a represents the amount of time spent in additional classes during weekends and is also multiplied by multiplier:\n     To simplify this approach since you don't need exact fraction usage: Assume x * y + 110 hours = total weekly times.\n\n11. Total class minutes per week including both weekdays (9.17) & weekend extra learning times \n   Using an equation that multiplies the number of regular classes with a constant factor to account for weekday and weekend times spent on additional learning.\n   \n12: Assuming some multiplier value used in this simplified approach, since you know how many total class hours per week he is spending:\n    So now find out what was assumed as 'a' when multiplying.\n\nNow calculating the above equation considering 55 minutes * number of classes = x\nSince we don't want to use complex fractions and assume that extra learning on weekends results in some constant value 'b', \nAssume total class hours per week (including weekend) is y.\ny= Regular weekly times + Extra Weekend Learning Time.\n\nFor this calculation, let's consider a factor by which regular school time gets multiplied:\n  Assume he multiplies his full weeks of classes including the extra ones with that multiplier to find how many more minutes are used for learning on weekends.\nNow calculate total class hours spent per week (x) in terms of 'a' and given data.\n\nSince we know that weekend times add up some constant value, let's say 110 or any other number:\nAssume a certain amount is added when calculating extra time during the weekends to make it simpler for understanding.\nThis assumption makes calculation easier since you can simply multiply by this factor instead of dealing with fractions.\n\n\nNow considering all these steps and simplifications made in our approach we'll now find out total class times per week spent on learning:\nLet's simplify using multiplier value 'm', \nmultiplier equals to the sum of",

Since there are normally 9 periods (or classes) for a normal student but Esteban takes an additional 3 classes, we can assume that his regular school period has been replaced by one of the three extra class sessions and he is still taking two more than usual.\n   So in total, Esteban goes to \"class\" for:\n   - The original number of periods (9) minus one for a replacement with an additional 3 classes: \n     This leaves us at having 8 + 1 = nine. However since that was the regular amount and he now has three more than normal so we keep it as is.\n   \n    We will add the time from his extra class sessions to this total:\n   - Original number of periods * each period's length: \n     $9*30=270$ minutes\n  - The additional classes' time, calculated before.

Next let's find the total extra learning time for Saturdays and Sundays:\n   Total minutes in a day = (24 hour)*60 minute/hour \n    Since there are two days of weekend, total 2 * (24*60)\n   \n6. Now to get six-fifths fraction: ((5/6) * (48 * 60))\n7. Add regular class hours and extra learning time for the full week.\n   Time spent by Jamal per week is:\n    (((9*35)/60)*6)+(((5/6)*(24*60)))\n\n8. Finally simplify it to find out total number of minutes he spends on his school every day\nTime spent in minutes =  ( ((315 +1000) * (2/3))   )\n Time spent per week is:\n \n9. Now convert the time from minute into hours, because there are sixty-five hundred and twenty minutes in an hour.\n  Time spent by Jamal for a whole week: \n\nAnswer: The final answer is $\\boxed{24.1666667}$.",

Next, to determine the total number of pieces Diego placed during that hour for both puzzles,\n   we need to add up all the pieces from both puzzles and divide by three since each puzzle took approximately an hour.\n   \n   However, a more accurate approach would be adding the completed first puzzle (276) with 867.\n\n3. So, let's do this:\n   Total = Completed piece of the first puzzle + Piece in second puzzle\n          = 411 - remaining one-third * 411 (since two-thirds were already done)\n          but since we have to add them both together for a correct total \n          instead subtracting and then adding it would make more sense here as he completed those pieces within that hour.\n\n   To find the number of piece left:  \n   One third of puzzle = 1/3 *411\n                        = 137\n\n   Now let's do this calculation:\n   Total = Completed first puzzle + second one \n          = (2/3)*411 - remaining part for both puzzles and then add completed pieces together within that hour \n          but a better way to calculate would be: \n           To find the total number of pieces placed by Diego, we can simply sum up all piece from 1st & 2nd puzzle as he finished one in an hour.\n\n   So let's do this:\n   Total = Completed first puzzle + second\n       = (411 - remaining part for both) isn't correct but since you know how many completed pieces were done \n        we can add two third of it and then the other piece i.e. 867\n    To find out, what was left in total after finishing one-third so subtracting would be wrong here to do this problem let's assume he placed that number as p. Then for second part since you know how many completed by him \n   Total = (2/3)*411 + 867\n\nStep by step calculation:\n(2/3) * 411 is not equal to total but it will give an idea of pieces which Diego would have done in first hour\nbut we can simply assume that he placed only the remaining part for one puzzle. But since you know how many completed, \nyou could calculate using this formula\n\nStep by step calculation:\nTotal = (2/3)*411 + 867 \n\nFirst lets find out: what was left of second part i.e. complete it and then subtract from total so we will be able to get the answer.\nOne third part is :   one-third * 411\n                        =1/3*411 \n                       let's calculate that value, (one-third) or in fraction form(1/3)*411=137\n\n\nNow lets do this:\n Total number of pieces in second puzzle: 867\n\nTo find remaining piece for the first part since we know he finished only two-thirds so now subtracting will not be correct. \nSo instead let's assume, total = p then complete one-third is given by (2/3)*p\nNow after completing that and placing it within an hour let him do 867 in same amount of time.\nLet x be remaining for the first part i.e. from second puzzle. So now,\ncomplete first part + Total number of pieces completed \n = p\n\nSince two-thirds was done we will get, (2/3) * 411 is not equal to total but it gives us an idea of how many were placed.\none-third would be: (1/3)*411=137\nNow since he has already finished that one third let's subtract this from his completed part in first hour and then add remaining piece i.e. x = Total - Complete \nTo find the complete number for both  :  we can use equation like:\nComplete = p \n\nwhere 'p' is a variable.\n\nBut since you know how many pieces were placed by Diego within that time so let's do this.\nThe total no of piece completed in first part + No. of Piece second puzzle has (given as) \nis equal to, the number he could complete in an hour\n\n(2/3)* 411+ x=867 or p = Complete \n\nNow for finding 'p' : one-third * 411 is not correct since we know how many pieces were done by Diego\nWe can simply assume that if two-thirds was completed then remaining part will be:\none third of total \n- (two thirds) i.e. it would give us, the value which remains in last hour.\nbut here our equation looks something like this \nComplete = 2/3 *411 + x\n\nTo find complete number for both we can use Total - Complete or simply add and subtract\nTotal number of pieces completed within one-hour (in second part) is given as:  \n867 \n\nNow since,",

First, we need to calculate the total amount Mateo spent on popcorn.\n   Since each bag of popcorn costs 75 cents and he bought 9 bags,\n   Total cost for popcorn = 9 * 0.75 = $6.75.\n\n2. Next, let's convert all amounts into Turkish Lira (₺) since we are given the amount in local currency.\n   We know that 1 USD is approximately equal to 8 Turkish Lira ($1 ≈ ₺8).\n   So,\n   Total cost for popcorn in ₺ = $6.75 * 8 ≈ ₺54.\n\n3. Now, let's calculate Mateo's total expenses and the amount of money left as a percentage.\n   We are given that he had 6% of his money left after buying both popcorn and cookies.\n   Let x be the total amount spent on cookies in ₺.\n   The total amount spent is equal to the cost of popcorn plus the cost of cookies,\n   so, Total amount = ₺54 + x.\n\n4. We also know that Mateo initially had ₺1200, which left 6% as change after all purchases.\n   Therefore, he must have spent 94% of his initial money (100% - 6%).\n   This means the total expenses can be expressed in terms of his initial amount:\n   Total expense = $1200 * 0.94 ≈ ₺1128.\n\n5. Now we equate this with our expression for 'Total amount':\n   ₺54 + x = ₺1128\n   Solving for x gives us the total spent on cookies.\n   \n6. Subtracting ₺54 from both sides of the equation, \n   We get: x ≈ ₺1074.\n\n7.

We know that the amount spent on crackers can be calculated by multiplying the cost of one bag by the number of bags bought.\n   Amount spent on crackers: 6 * €0.25 = €1.50\n\n3. Let's assume Faisal bought 'x' bags of popcorn at €0.5 per bag.\n\n4. The total amount he spent is equal to his initial spending minus the change received (2% of €1400).\n   Total spent = Initial Spending - Change\n             = €1400 - 2%\n                    = €1400 - €28\n                     = €1372\n\n5.

To solve for 'x', first subtract €1.50 from both sides to isolate terms with 'x'.\n   €0.5x = €1372 - €1.50\n         = €1370.5\n   \n7. Now, divide by €0.5 on both sides:\n    x = 1370.5 / 0.5\n       = 2741\n\nHowever, this is the total cost of popcorn for all bags bought in terms of number of 'units' or bags (since each unit costs €0.5). We need to find how many individual pieces of popcorn Faisal actually purchased.\n\nSince we calculated that he spent a certain amount on popcorn and the question asks specifically about popcorn, let's correct our steps:\n\n8. Given that his total expenditure was €1372, if all this money went towards crackers (which is not possible since it also includes buying popcorn), then there would have been an error in initial assumptions or calculation.\n   Re-evaluating: \n    - Faisal bought 6 bags of crackers for a combined cost of €1.50\n    The rest of the money was spent on other items, likely including some amount of popcorn.\n\nHowever, we must realize that his total spending actually should be calculated considering he got change as well.\n   Let's assume all initial assumptions were correct and recalculate:\n   \n9. Given 2% of €1400 is used for a small change (which might have been incorrectly assumed in steps above) \n    Correcting previous equation, let’s correctly determine Faisal spent money on both crackers & popcorn:\n\n10.

Let's re-analyze:\n    The equation is still: \n       Cost of Crackers + x * (Cost per Popcorn) = Total money spent before change\n    However, since the initial assumption might have been incorrect or misleading due to miscalculation.\n   Assume 'y' for number of popcorn bags bought at 50 cents each:\n        €1.5+€0.5y=€1373\n\n12. Solving this equation by subtracting €1.5 from both sides and then dividing by the cost per bag (€0.5):\n    x = y\n       €0.5y = €1372 - €1.50\n           = €1370.5 \n         so,  x= 2741\n\nHowever, this number is not correct as it assumes Faisal spent his entire money on popcorn after buying crackers (which cannot be since change was also considered).

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\nTo solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\n1. We need to find the total number of people who left after 45 minutes.\n2. Three-fifths (or 3/5) of all the teachers and nurses left. To calculate this, we'll first determine how many teachers stayed by using the information given - since there are three teachers missing out of five for every group.\n\nWe know that 25 teachers stayed at the meeting. Since one teacher represents a fifth of each staff (because they represent only one set), if 4/5 were to leave then all would have left, but we can calculate how many left by determining what fraction was present and multiplying it with the total number of people.\n\n3. The given information states that three-fifths of both teachers and nurses left. If 'x' is the common multiple for each set (in this case 5), then one group has 25 while another would have had five times as many.\n   Since there are a total of x = number*of staff present initially \n    Total Teachers=67\n     Number of Nurses =68  \n 3/5 *x =Total left out teachers or nurses \n\n4. We know that if we want to find how much was left for either the teacher group, nurse group separately and then combine them.\n   Let's first calculate total number of people who were present in this meeting: \n      Total staff (teachers +nurses)  x=67+68 =135\n    Since three-fifths left out lets assume common multiple as 'x'\n   so if we find what value is there for one group, then we will be able to get the other by multiplying with five and dividing with total number of groups.\n   \n5. Three-fifth leave means two fifth remain (because 1-3/5=2/5).\n6. Let's calculate how many teachers stayed:\n   Since three-five lefts represent x\n     if we want one group out of every 'x' to be equal in count then that would also mean five for other sets.\n    Therefore: \n       remaining teachers = 67-(3/5)*67  \n         because number representing 2/5 is same as the total- number represented by 1/5. In our case we can say (total *number of group) equals to number left in one group and if two groups have equal numbers then only five will be present for other set.\n    Hence remaining teachers =67 - (3*67)/5 \n                     =67-(201/5)\n                    = 67-40.2\n                      Since we can't leave out fraction of a teacher, it means total left is rounded to the nearest integer which would also mean that in reality three fifth were not present so lets assume there was one group with four teachers and another with five for comparison.\n    Now let's calculate remaining nurses by using same logic:\n        3/5 *x \n         (because we want what number represents two groups)\n   =1/5*x  \n     So, the total left in 'one' set will be x - (number of people represented by three fifth) and that equals to\n      Number left for one group= 68-(4*68)/5 \n\n7. Since if you have assumed numbers with five then other would also follow same pattern:\n   Hence let's do calculation as follows:\n    remaining nurses = 68-((3/1)*68)\n                        =67 \n                          \n\n\nStep by step reasoning is complete.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 47",

To find out how many nurses left we can directly calculate:\nNumber of nurses who went = Total number of people that went - Number of engineers \n= 3/5 * Initial total number - Number of engineers\nHowever since all the engineer are still there and three-fifths (33) in general have gone, to get the correct answer we need to find out how many nurse left first.\nWe know:\nTotal nurses = 21 \nNumber of people that went = Total number of people * 3/5 \n\nSo,\nTotal nurses who went = Number of nurses who went + Number of engineers\n= (Total nurses) * (number of people that left / total people)\nHowever this equation can be simplified to the following:\nLet's find out how many nurse have been gone and then subtract it from initial number.\nWe know \n3/5 * Total number  = 33\n\nTo get correct answer let us first calculate total number by solving for \"Total\".

Therefore, \nthe correct answer lies between (33 - 21) and (55-33)\n= 12   <= n <= 22\nSince only one value can be given as final answer let's now try to calculate the number of nurses that stayed.\n\nNumber of engineers who went = Total Engineers * Number of people left / Initial total \n= 34 * (3/5) \nHowever this is not needed in question so, we just need to find out how many nurse are present at celebration.

Simplifying that expression gives us:\n     (1 / 3)(x) = total number staying\n         which we know is equal to the given amount of remaining artists at conference.\n             Now let's find x using this equation: \n              Total people left - those stayed are equals to ((2/3)x).\n            Since only one third stay. So if two-thirds leave:\n                 To figure that out, use (1 / 3) * total number of attendees = amount staying.\n\n7. Solving for 'x' by plugging in the known values: \n   If we know there were initially a certain people and after going ((2/3)x)\n    So if one third stayed:\n      To find how many are left, use this equation to get x (the initial total attendees number): \n           Since 21 artists represent those staying.\n            Total amount of remaining lawers is now equal to that which represents the fraction:   (1 - ((2 /3)x)\n                   We can simplify it further using 'x' = total people initially as follows:\n                    To find out how many are left, plug in values for x. \n             First let's calculate number who went by calculating remaining lawers.\n              Since only 21 artists stay then all the other attendees represent those leaving (one third).\n            If we know there were a certain amount of total people and one third stayed:\n                Total people = Remaining",

Since two-thirds of all attendees left, one-third must have stayed. Let x be the total number of staff members (teachers + doctors) who attended initially.\n \nFrom this information: \n\n1/3 * Total = 19\nTotal = 19 * 3 = 57\n\nNow we know there were a total of 57 people at the celebration.\n\nGiven that initially, there were 34 teachers and 62 doctors. Let's calculate how many staff members attended:\nStaff Members (initial) = Teachers + Doctors = 34 + 62 = 96\nSince Total number of attendees was indeed 57: \nWe can conclude that initial total is correct.\n\n\nLet's now find the remaining number of doctors after two hours, when one-third left.\n\nNumber of people who stayed initially and still present would be (1/3) * staff members.\nThe amount of time given doesn't impact how we figure this out in relation to finding the solution. However: 57 = staff x (2/3)\n\n\nLet's do some rearranging:\nStaff Members = Total / Fraction that left\nx = 57/( 2/3 )\n   = 57 * ( 3/2 ) \n     = 85\n\n\nSince we now know there are a total of 96 people, and the remaining number is staff x (1/3).\nRemaining Doctors: \n\nNumber of doctors who stayed = Total - Teachers\n= Staff Members - Number of teachers who left\n   Since one-third were leaving:\nDoctors that remained would be \nTotal - Remaining Fraction * Initial total \n\nSo if we know staff members are 85, then number remaining is calculated as follows:\n\nFraction representing the amount remaining: (1/3) \nRemaining Doctors = Total - Teachers\n= Staff Members - Number of teachers who left\n\nWe now have enough info:\nSince two-thirds were leaving and that leaves one-third. If total people at event was staff x 2/3, then for a number as low as 'x' to give us the same amount (57) when multiplied by 1/3 we'd find x is 85\nAnd with this information: Total - Teachers = Staff Members - Number of teachers who left\n\n\nSince total people at event would be staff members times two-thirds, that means there are:\n(2 * 85)/ 3 \n   or \n    (170) /3 \n\nNow let's calculate the remaining doctors:\n\nDoctors Remaining\n= Doctors Initial - ((2/3)* Doctors initial)\n= 62 - ( 2* 62 ) /3\n\n\nWe can now substitute in numbers for our equation:\n\n\n(1)\n\nEquation: x = 85, and using this lets us determine:\nx   is staff members, total people leaving equals two-thirds\nso remaining fraction would be one-third. Let's break it down as follows:\n\nTo calculate number of doctors left after the event we simply use \n Doctors Initial - ( Two Thirds * Total )\nor \n\nLet x represent initial amount of teachers + doctors.\n\nIf 19 Teachers stayed then: \nx = staff Members times two-thirds\n   Or:\n(2)  \nTotal people staying at celebration would be equivalent to one-third. Let's calculate the number remaining now.\n\n\nEquation : Staff - Number leaving\n\n\nDoctors Remaining\n= ( Doctors Initial * (1/3))\n= Total  /Staff members - Teachers \n   = ((2* x )/3)\n\n\nx is staff total amount: lets say:\nTotal people initially was indeed 'x'. We already know there were a total of 57 staying at event so let's solve this.\n\n\nEquation to find initial number (85): \n\nSince one-third remained, the other two-thirds left. Two thirds leaving would mean remaining fraction equals one third\nNumber who stayed: staff members times one-third = Total \nStaff is x\n\n\nx   or     Staff total amount  (number of people)\n= Staff * 1/3 = Number Remaining Doctors\n\nWe can now substitute in our equation.\n\n\nDoctors Initial - ((2*62) /3)\n\n\nLet's simplify:\n( Doctor Initial ) \n\n=( Doctor initial ) -( Two Thirds doctor )\n= Total\n doctors remaining\n\n\n\nThe number of doctors who stayed equals: \nDoctor Initial * ( 1/3 )\n\nNow let's calculate that for us.\n\nTo solve this problem we'll first determine total amount.\nSince teachers left two-thirds, and one-third remained so to find the initial:\nTotal people at event = staff members x two thirds\nStaff Members is 'x'. Thus Total = x\n\n\nOne third of remaining fraction means 1/3.

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\nTo find out how many nurses are left, we first need to determine the total number of people who stayed at the meeting. \n\nWe know that 30 engineers stayed and two-fifths (2/5) of the total number of people left. Since 41 engineers initially attended and only 11 remained (after losing 3 out of every 4), it implies one-fourth were present.\n\nSince there are more nurses than engineers, let's denote the initial number of remaining nurses as 'x'. Given that two-fifths of all attendees left, we can set up an equation for total people. The ratio of remaining to those who leave should hold true across both groups: \n- Engineers stayed 3/5 times (11 out of 41) and Nurses stayed x/(74+x).\n\nWe know from the problem statement that 30 engineers are still at the meeting, which means we can represent this mathematically:\n(3/4)*41 = 30. Since this doesn't seem to help us directly in terms of solving for nurses, let's try another method.\n\nGiven two-fifths left, then three-quarters stayed.\n- Engineers initially were (1 - 2/5) or four-fifths (of the total), and we are told they lost one out of every four engineers:\nWe have a ratio equation that represents those who remained from both groups. For this problem: \n(3/4)*41 = number remaining engineers\nand for nurses, it's x/(74+x).\n\nBut first let's see what fraction of people is left if we were to just multiply the fractions together as a proportion:\nSince two-fifths (2 out of 5) are gone and three-quarters or four fifths remain: \n4/5 * number who started in each group = Number remaining. \n\nWe can now write an equation for engineers, where 'number' is simply stated above.\n- For Engineers it's 3 / 4 times their original amount:\n(3/4)*41\nAnd then the same principle applies to nurses.\n\nTo find out how many total people were at first, we need a number representing all attendees and can do that by adding those of engineers and nurse together: \n41 + 74 = 115. We now know there are two-fifths gone:\n- Two-fifths is equivalent to (2/5)*total = Number left.\nSo for total people who attended, we multiply this equation with the number representing all attendees at first.\n\nNow that we have a better sense of how many nurses remained let's directly find out using what was provided:\n\n(3/4) * 41 represents engineers remaining after losing (1-2/5), or four-fifths. Now apply similar logic for nurse group: \nx/(74+x). Let x be number remaining nurses:\nSince we are given that a total of two-fifth's left, then three-quarters stayed.\nTo solve this problem let us assume 'n' as the initial number of people at first meeting (41 + 74 = 115), where n represents all attendees in group and also is our denominator for determining proportion. \nSo if we are to determine how many nurses remain after two-fifths left, then three-quarters stayed.\n\n3/4 * total remaining engineers would be same as: \n\n(3/5)*n - (2/5) of initial number people\n\nLet's solve equation and get the answer:\n\nWe will use 'N' for representing the number of nurse at first meeting.\nNow apply similar logic to determine nurses who left:\nx = N * 2 / 5\nTo find total remaining engineers we have: \n(3/4)*41.\n\nGiven that two-fifths are gone, then three-quarters stayed. The problem now is finding 'N'.\n\nLet's equate the equation with those of nurse and engineer group (both left). If number representing people in each groups who remain after losing 2 out of every five leaves at same proportion as others we can write:\n(3/4) * N - ((number remaining engineers)/(total)) = x / n\n\nIf 'N' represents initial number of nurses then \nSince two-fifths left and three-quarters stayed (or four-fifth). Now, let us solve for total people: \n\n- 30 Engineers are the ones who remain.\nNow we have to find out how many Nurses were there initially.\n\nLet's represent all attendees by 'N'. Since:\n41 engineers remained after losing one-fourth of their initial number and only three-quarters stayed. We know this is true, but can write in terms of N as well for nurses:\nIf the total people are denoted by 'n', then (3/4) * n represents those who left.\n\nFor Engineer group: 41 engineers were present initially.\nAnd now represent engineer remaining after losing one-fourth and solve it to get number representing nurse at first meeting. \nSince we know that only three-quarters stayed, let's write",

Next, calculate how many people left in half an hour. Since they stayed for a whole half-hour, we can assume that all those who leave do so within this time frame and thus are accounted for by their fraction (which is also the portion of the total number of individuals). \n3. Given 18 artists stayed at the celebration: Artists_stayed = Total_artists - Left_artists.\n4. Since half an hour has passed, we can calculate that:\n   a) The remaining people after half an hour are those who didn't leave in that time frame.\n5. We know 2/4 of total number left (so 1-2/4=2/4 or one-fourth stayed). \n6. Calculate the artists left using their proportion: Artists_left = Total_artists - Artists_stayed\n7. To get this value we must first find what fraction of people are doctors since then we can calculate how many doctors left:\n8. Doctors_fraction = 1-2/4=2/4 or half.\n9.

We're given that 20 doctors stayed at the meeting after four-fifths of them left and half an hour passed.\n   \n5. This means all lawyers must have left because if any lawyer had also stayed (in addition to those who were supposed to leave), then there would be more than just 20 remaining doctors.\n\n6. To find out how many people, in total, are still present at the meeting:\n   Total remaining = Number of doctors staying + Remaining number of lawyers\n                  = 20 + x\n\n7.

To compare that with 20 staying out of initial (52):\n   Number of doctors staying / Total number of initial doctors = Remaining fraction\n\nThis leads us to calculate:\n   Number of doctors staying * 5/4 \n     Since there are four-fifths left.\n\nLet's use this proportion for simplification\nStep 9: Now, using the same logic but comparing it with what we know about remaining people now,\nWe simplify our calculation by finding out how many should have stayed in total.\n   Total number of initial doctors and lawyers = \n     (52 * 5/4) + x\n\nSince there are four-fifths left which is equivalent to one-fifth that has remained. Let's compare this:\nIf we calculate the value for 'x' as a proportion, using comparison with what remains,\nwe know it should be equal when multiplied by five and divided by 4.\nNow let's find out x = (20 * total number of people staying) / Total initial doctors \nHowever since we're only comparing that to the remaining part which is proportional, here:\n   Number of lawyers left at meeting\nWe have a direct comparison for finding how many are there now in proportion as follows:\nx = 20/52\n\nAnswer: The final answer is $\\boxed{10}$",

To find out how many were there initially and after removing:\n   Initial total - After removing\n    => x - y = 108-45 where 'y' stands for all people (both doctor's, nurse's) leaving.\n        => The difference between initial and final is the number of remaining person which was calculated in step3 as \n             Total nurses + Total doctors after removals. That means: Total number present now= x+y \n\n9. Now we can find out total people left by:\n    Initial - Final\n     (108-45)\n       => 63\n\n10. Since there's a one to nine ratio for the whole population, \n   then each unit in this equation corresponds with ten percent of it and its respective group which leaves only three units for all doctors.\n   \n11. Now we can find out how many people left:\n    Doctors who remained = Total remaining nurses / (1/9)\n                       => 33/ (1/9) \n\n12. Divide by 3 to get the final number, since 'y' is a one to nine ratio of total population which equates three times as much for each doctor leaving.\n   Number of doctors left at celebration = Doctors remaining now \n = Total initial nurse - Remaining nurse's\n => (9/1) *33 / 3\n\n13. Calculate the final answer:\n    Final number of Doctor = ((9*11)/3)\n                          => The total is : \n\nAnswer: The final answer is 99.",

To find the new value, we'll add 45% of the initial price to the initial price:\n   Increase amount = Initial cost * (Increase percentage / 100)\n                    = ¥600 * (45/100)\n                    = ¥270\n   New value after increase = Initial cost + Increase amount\n                            = ¥600 + ¥270\n                            = ¥870\n\n3. In the second year, there's a decrease of 20% in stock price:\n   Decrease amount = New value after first year * (Decrease percentage / 100)\n                    = ¥870 * (20/100)\n                    = ¥174\n   Final value after decrease = New value after increase - Decrease amount\n                              = ¥870 - ¥174\n                              = ¥696\n\nAnswer: The final answer is ¥696.",

The time she spends skipping will be the remaining one-half of total time.\n   Since we know her walking speed is 5mph and her running speed is 10mph, so her skipping speed would have been half to that value because it's given as (1/2) * t_r\n   Time spent Skipping (t_s) = Total hours - Time Spent Running \n                            => t_s = 8 hrs - 4 hrs\n                             => t_s = 4 hrs\n\n7. Now we know the time Daphne spends in each activity: she runs for 4 hours, walks for a portion of her total time and skips for another portion.\n   Total walking Time (t_w) is equal to half the remaining time \n   The fraction that will represent this would be given by t_r + t_s / total_hours = (2/5).\n   \nSo we can calculate the actual value using:\nTime spent Walking, t_w = 8 hrs * (1 - 4 hr) / 8\n= 8 hrs * (0.75)\n= 6 hours.\n\nNow to find out how many miles she travels in total: \n- In walking time Daphne covers a distance of Distance_walked = Speed_walk * Time_spent_Walking  \n= 5 mph * 6 hr.\n= 30 miles\n\n- For running, we can use the formula Distance_runned = Speed_running*Time_spend_running\n= 10 mph * (4 hrs)\n= 40 miles.\n\n- And for skipping: \nWe already know her speed is half that of walking which would be:\n   Skipping_speed = Walking_speed /2 \n                 => Skipping_speed = 5/2 \n                   => Skipping_speed = 2.5 \n\nDistance_skipped = Speed_skipping*Time_spent_skipping\n= (Skipping_speed)*4 hr.\n= (2.5 mph) * 4 hr.\n=10 miles\n\nSo, total distance covered is Distance_walked + Distance_runned + Distance Skipped \n=30+40+10=80 \n\nAnswer: The final answer is 80.",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. Let's first determine Xena's speed while running and walking.\n   Since she can skip at 8 miles per hour, which is four-fifths of her running speed,\n   we need to find the value for her running speed.\n\n2. We know that 4/5 * (her running speed) = 8\n   So her running speed = 8 / (4/5)\n   Simplifying this expression gives us: \n   Her running speed = 10\n\n3. Now, we need to find out how much time she spends on each activity in the given period.\n   She can spend at most 6 hours for both activities combined.\n\n   Since she is walking four-sixths of the total time and spending one-third of her time while running,\n   let's set up equations using 'x' as a variable to represent her walk duration:\n   \n   The sum of all three states (running, skipping & walking) should add up to 6 hours\n   Her walk time is represented by four-sixths * x.\n   Her run time can be expressed in terms of the total remaining times - i.e. one-third + one-sixth = five-sixths or 5/6\n\n4. Let's represent her running duration as 'y'. Then we have:\n   \n   y (her walk) + y (running & skipping)= x\n   From equation above, \n   We find out that she spends: four sixth part of total time while walking and one third + one sixths part for the other two states combined.\n\n5. Now calculate how many hours Xena will spend running at 10 miles per hour.\nSince her run duration 'y' can also be expressed in terms of x as follows:\n   Her walk time is represented by four-sixths * x\n   And she spends one-third + one-sixth part for the other two states combined, i.e., (1/3) + (1/6)\n   So we have: y = 5x / 6 \n   \n6. Now calculate total hours Xena will spend running.\nGiven her run time is represented as 'y'. Total duration she spends while walking & skipping -i.e. four-sixths part of the given six hour period:\n4 * (total_duration/1) which we can write in equation form as:  x = (2/3)\n   So Xena will spend two hours on a walk.\nNow calculate her run time 'y'. \nSince, y + running_time= total_duration\n   where Total duration is six hour & the other one-third of that is spent walking so it's equal to 4 * (total_duration /1) or x = (2/3)\n   Therefore: x -y equals to two hours\n\nNow calculate 'x' \nwe found out earlier in equation y=5x/6. We know now, x -(5x/6)=2\n    so multiply all term with 6 and we get the following expression:\n     6 * (6x-5* x) = 12.\n   This simplifies to: \n     (1/3)x=12\n\nNow let's solve for 'x'.\nWe have that \n(1/3)* x = 12\nso multiply both sides by 3 on left-hand side we get:\n    x = (36).\nSo Xena walks four-sixths part of total six hour duration, therefore she will walk for:   ((2/6) * 6)=2 hours.\nNow let's calculate how many miles she can travel while walking at the given speed. \nGiven that her walking time is two and we know her speed i.e.,4 mile per hour.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is $\\boxed{8}$.",

We know she skips at 3 miles per hour, which is 2/4 as fast as she runs. So, if we let x be the speed of Haruka when she runs,\n   (2/4)x = 3\n3. Now solve for x by multiplying both sides by 4 and then dividing both sides by 2.\n   2x = 12\n   x = 6 miles per hour\n\nSo, Haruka can run at a speed of 6 miles per hour.\n\n4. Next, we need to calculate the time she spends walking and running in 10 hours since those are known variables now that we have her speeds.\n5. She walks for (2/5) * 10 = 4 hours\n   And runs for (3/5)* 10 = 6 hours\n\n6. Now, let's find out how far she can travel by walking and running in the given time periods.\n7. Distance walked is speed of walk multiplied by duration it takes her to complete that distance \n8. She walks at a constant pace but we don't know what this value is yet so for now leave as x (we will determine later).\n   So 4 * x = unknown\n9. Similarly, the total running distance can be found using speed of run and time she runs.\n10 Distance runned by her in given time duration which equals to \n    Speed of Run multiplied with Time Spent Running: 6 hours \n\n11 To get this value we do simple multiplication since that is how you calculate distances at a constant rate:\n   So the answer here =  6 * x (Here 'x' denotes speed as calculated above)\n12 The final distance traveled will be sum total of all these values \n13 Since she walks and runs for different durations but has to spend three-fifths time running that means while walking is less duration in her life span we know this. Thus, when you multiply the run value by (3/5)  =   6 * x * (3/5).\n14 The other distance will be traveled using multiplication of walk speed with total remaining hours she walked and spent:\n    So it equals to: \n     Here is where 'x' denotes unknown speed value we found earlier as Haruka runs at a pace of six miles per hour. In her case, since this problem asks for final result that must include only number so there are no fractions.\n   For walk the distance = 4 * (6/5)\n15 Now let's simplify:\n16 At first glance it may look complicated but we know she walks four hours out of ten total \n17 And thus when you multiply these two values together, her walking speed and time spent on this activity as a result is equal to: \n   Distance = 24 / 5\n18 The distance traveled in run value will be calculated similarly.\n19 Since the given answer should just have number (as per question requirements) it means we need calculate only that one part which is going multiply by her running speed:\n20 i.e. Multiply Haruka's walking time for hours spent on a single activity and then divide this product with total time she spends in an hour since we don't know what the actual distance value will look like at first.\n   Distance = 6 * (3/5)\n21 The answer now is to simplify: \n22 It can be done by multiplying both numbers together:\n    So, you just multiply them and add values calculated above - i.e\n   Final Answer for total Haruka's travel in given duration will look like this:\n23 Here we get the number as 24/5 + (18/5)\n      = Total distance covered \n= 42 /5 \n\nAnswer: The final answer is $\\boxed{8.4}$",

Since it is given that he has a total of 28 oranges, we can equate x to 28.\n3. Now, using this information from step 1 and equation (i), we get the number of bananas = 8 * 28 = 224.\n4. However, after buying more at the store, Xavier now has 'x + 63' oranges in his house.\n5. We are given that he bought 26 fewer bananas than the new total number of oranges.\n6. Therefore, we can equate (number of original bananas) - 26 = x + 63\n7. From step 3 and equation (vi), we have: \n   (224 - 26) = (x + 63)\n8. Simplifying this gives us:\n    198 = x + 63\n9. Solving for 'x' from the above, we get:\n    x = 135\n\nHowever, since we initially assumed that there are only oranges in Xavier's house with a value of 28 (and calculated number of bananas using it), \nthere seems to be some confusion here.\n\nCorrecting our understanding and interpretation:\n\n1. We have been told Xavier bought more oranges but fewer bananas than the new total orange.\n2. So, initially let 'x' represent original oranges = 28\n3. New oranges are x + 63 (according to statement)\n   Hence we equate this with:\n   Original Oranges:      X  \nNew Total Orange        :X+63 \n\n4. The relationship between the number of bananas and oranges given in problem is that there are eight times as many banana's as orange.\n5. Let original no. of Banana be Y \n6. New total Banana = (Y-26) where 'Y' represents originally available\n7. Since new Orange  : X +63\n8. According to the statement, The number of bananas is 26 less than oranges i.e:\n   No.of banana(Y)=New Orange(X+63)-26\n\n9. Substituting value we got earlier in equation (vii) and substituting New orange = x + 63 \n10. This becomes: Y=(x + 63) -26\n11. Since number of Banana originally was 'Y', it can be re-written as:\n   Original banana=Y  \nNew Total Banana    :=Original Banana-Y+26\n\n12. Putting this equation in (ix), we get the following relation:\n\n      x       =((X-26)+26)\n     28        =(x -26) + 26\n13. Solving for 'x' from above gives:\n   X               =54 \n\nNow let's find Original Banana and New Orange given these values.\nOriginal Banana= (Y)=(8* X)= ((8 * 54)) \n                 =432\n\nNew orange       = x+63  \n                 =(28 +63)    \n                 =91\n14.

To find the initial number of corns (x), we need to solve for it:\n   Solving the above equation, \n   43 = x + 48,\n   Subtracting 48 from both sides gives us: \n      - x = 43 - 48\n           => x = -5\n\nHowever, since you can't have a negative number of items in this context (as it is not possible to buy or own -5 corns), there seems to be an issue with the initial problem setup given.\n\nBut if we proceed as initially planned:\n\nx = -5. However, pears and corn cannot be negative so lets re-examine our calculations \n\n2. We are also given that Alejandro bought 48 more corns at the store.\n   This gives us a total number of corns: x + 48\n\n3.

We know that Oscar initially has a total of 33 persimmons in his house. So we have x = 33 (since initial number of persimmons equals to given value)\n3. Then he bought 65 more persimmons at the store, so new number of persimmons is: x + 65\n4. We are also told that Oscar has 28 fewer grapes than persimmons after buying more. This can be written as an equation: 5x - (x+65) = 28.\n   Now we solve for 'x' in the above equation:\n   First simplify the equation by distributing and combining like terms:\n     => 4x-65= 28\n    Next, add 65 to both sides of the equation:\n      =>  4x -65 + 65 = 28+65 \n       => 4x  =93 \n        Then divide by 4 on both side to get value of x:    \n         =>   (4x/4) = (93 / 4)\n          =>    x=23.25\n5. Now that we know the number of persimmons, we can find the new total for grapes:\nSince Oscar bought more and he now has a few fewer grapes than before.\nSo let's first calculate initial amount of grapes which is: \n   Initial Amount = 5 * (Initial Persimmens)\n                  = 5*33\n                 =>       Initial Grapes=165\n    \n6.

We know that there are nine times as many figs as persimmons, so the initial number of figs will be 9x.\n\n2. However, we also need to find out how many new persimmons and figs he bought at the store.\n3. Since Oscar has a total of 64 persimmons initially (as given in the problem), 'x' must equal 64 because that's how we got our initial amount of figs from him.\n\n4. Now, let's calculate the number of new persimmons: He bought 54 more persimmons.\n   - The final total number of persimmons will be x + 54\n   - But 'x' is equal to 64 (because he had a total of 64 initially), so we need to add these two amounts together.\n\n5. To find the new amount of figs, Oscar bought 44 fewer than his initial amount of persimmons.\n   - Since there were 9 times as many figs when 'x' was equal to 64 (from step 1) and that is 576, subtracting 44 from this number gives us:\n     576 - 44 = 532\n    So the new total number of figs Oscar has in his house will be 532.\n\n6. To find combined totals now we need add both 'new persimmons' (64 + 54) and the amount he bought for figs, which is 532.\n   - The final calculation becomes:\n     Total = (x+ new purchase of Persimmon)+ New total number of Figs\n      We know x=64 so its \n        Total=(64+54)+(new purchased Figs)\n          Which will be\n            Total=(118) +  532 \n\nStep by step reasoning complete. Now calculating the final answer.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 650",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. Let's denote the number of oranges as O and persimmons as P.\n2. We are given that there are six times as many persimmons as oranges, so we can write this relationship as: \n   P = 6O\n3. Since Bodhi has a total of 73 oranges in his house initially, we set up the equation:\n   O + P = 73\n   \n4. We also know that Bodhi bought 60 more oranges and 35 fewer persimmons than the number of oranges.\n5. After buying more oranges and having fewer persimmons, he now has: \n   New total orange = Initial orange + Additional orange\n                  = O + 60\n\n6. Since there are 35 fewer persimmons:\n   P - additional reduction in persimmons (which is equivalent to the number of new oranges bought) will remain as P initially because Bodhi bought more oranges and reduced persimmon count proportionally.\n   \n7. To find out how many persimmons were initially at his house, substitute O with 73 from equation step 3 into it:\n   P = 6*O\n      P = 6 * (Initial orange)\n      \n8. Substituting Initial orange value as 73 and solve for initial Persimmon number: \n   P = 6*(73)  \n       P = 438\n\n9. Now that we know the values of oranges (73 + additional bought, which is O+60) and persimmons before buying:\n   New total orange after purchasing more will be O + (O + 60). So to find out how many oranges Bodhi now has in his house: \n      Total Orange = Initial Oranges + Additional purchased\n                    = O + O + 60  \n                     = 2*73+60\n\n10. Calculate the value for new total orange number:\n     New orages value= (2 * initial orange) + additional bought.\n           First calculate twice of Initial oranges: \n                 2*(Initial Orange)\n                      =   146\n                    Next add to it Additional Oranges purchased which is added in last step i.e. \"60\". \n                Now total orange Bodhi now has:\n                     New orages value= (initial * two) + additional bought.\n                            Total new oranges after buying more will be O+O+60\n\n        The final number of oranges = 2*73+60\n                           =146 + 60  \n                                 =206\n\n\n11. Now that we know the initial values and new total orange number:\n   Calculate Initial persimmons value in Step (8)\n   \n     P=6 *initial Orange \n      Initial persimmon Bodhi had is 438.\n     \n12. Since there are fewer Persimmons after buying by same quantity of additional oranges purchased,\n   to find out how many persimmons Bodhi bought, subtract the reduction i.e., 35 from it: \n\n    Final number of persimmons = (Initial Number) - Reduction\n     The final number of persimmon is P-35 \n      First calculate Initial Persimon value which we know in Step(8).\n   \n   Then do this calculation for new total orange after buying more:\n   New Total Oranges=O+60\n\n  Calculate how many oranges Bodhi had before purchasing: O + additional purchased will be equal to New Orange number (because he bought same amount of both the fruit). \n  From previous step we know that New orages value is =2*73 + 60\n   The initial orange was 73 so it becomes:\n     Initial Oranges=O+additional purchased =New oranges value - additional purchased.\n                    O+60-60\n\n          Simplifying this expression by removing constants from both sides: \n              It will be equal to new orages number which we already calculated in step (10)\n                 We know New total orange is 206, now calculate Initial Orange Bodhi had\n                  =New Oranges - Additional purchased\n                     O+60-60\n\n                    Calculate the value of initial oranges and subtracting constants \n                           From previous steps:\n                      The final answer for new orages=O+60.\n\n            Subtract constant \"60\" from it to get:   Initial orange  Bodhi had.\n               It will be equal to New Orange number minus Additional purchased i.e. =206-60\n                    =146\n\n\n13. Since we now know how many oranges and persimmons there are:\n   Total combined total of the number of persimmons and oranges is \n     P + O \n\n        We already calculated that Bodhi had 438 Initial Persimon value and 73 initial Oranges value.\n         Then calculate it by adding both values together.\n\nStep-by-step calculation to find out how many bodi has now:\n New orages=206\n   The final number of oranges =146\n\n    So let's add the two: \n        Total combined total Bodhi will have is P+O i.e.,",

It's mentioned that there are five times as many kiwis as bananas in his house initially.

Since there are usually no negative quantities in this context we can assume he actually got a few more or same as the bananas.

The total number of bananas is given as 93, but Leon bought more at the store, increasing his banana count to B + 42 (since he already had 93).\n4. Since B represents the initial number of bananas and we want it in terms of its increase or decrease due to shopping: \n   - Initial bananas = Total bananas after buying\n5. Therefore, B = 93.\n6. The total number of apples can be found by adding 25 fewer apples than bananas:\n    A = (B + 42) - 25  \n7. Substituting the value of B into this equation: \n   A = (93 + 42) - 25\n8.

The problem mentions that each student only participates in one group (football, volleyball, or basketball). Therefore, we need to add up the total number of students from all three groups.\n   However, it does not specify how many are playing football and how many are playing volleyball but since there is no overlap mentioned between any two sports. We can just assume that all 16 players for football play another sport (either basketball or volleyball) so we don't need to consider those in the total count of students.\n   \n3. To get the total number of students, add up only football and volleyball players along with basketball:\n   Total = Football + Volleyball + Basketball\n         = Number playing one group + Number playing other groups \n          however it is given that all 16 are doing either basketball or another sport so let us assume some X in place of them.\n   Let's say there are 'X' students who play football and volleyball. Since total number for each respective game (football/volleyball) will be double the value we get i.e, \n         Total = Football + Volleyball\n                 = 16 +32 \n                     =48 \n\n4. Now to find X add other sports players into equation: We know that there are some students who only do either basketball or football so let us just put them as one group of 'X' and the rest will be the remaining students:\n   Total number for all three game (basketball,football,volleyball) = 48 +24+26 \n           X + 96 = total \n\n5. Now we can find out value for 'X'\n       We already know that there are some student only playing football and volleyball but it is given in the question to do either of sports so let us assume all basketball players play one sport i.e, they will also be counted into X.\n        Therefore Total students = 48+24+26\n =98 \n\n6. So here 'X' must be equal to total number of football and volleyball (16+32=48)\n       And we know the value for X is already calculated as above.\n\nStep by step calculation:\nSo let's now find out final answer i.e,\nTotal students \n      Total = Football + Volleyball\n            = 16 + 32  \n              = 48 \n\nAnswer: The final answer is 98.",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n1. First, let's find the total amount of money spent on one round of laser tag for Valentina and her friends.\n2. The cost per person is not given directly in the problem statement; however we are told that a round of laser tag costs €8 per player. We will need to figure out how many people she plans to invite based solely off of expenses mentioned (laser tag, roller coaster rides) with the budget being for Valentina and her friends combined.\n3. Next, let's calculate the cost of 5 roller-coaster tickets: \n   - Cost = Number of Rides * Price per Ride\n   - Since we don't know how many people will be on these rides yet (Valentina or her guests), we can represent this number as 'x' where x is either just Valentina, all friends and herself combined.\n4. The roller coaster ticket price costs €9 a ride: \n   - Total cost = 5 * €9\n   - To calculate total amount for the rides: $45 (€9*5)\n5. Now let's add up what we know:\n- Cost of laser tag per person is unknown but since this has to be figured out by looking at expenses and budget, it seems reasonable that its cost should have been included in initial information.\n6. Total money spent on roller coaster tickets = €45\n7. Since Valentina wants 5 rides for herself: \n   - She will need a total of €9 * 5 or €45 to ride the roller coasters as many times as she wishes (in this case five).\n8. We also know that there is an additional requirement: pinball tokens, which cost €5 each.\n9. The only unknown we can solve now using what information has been given - lets consider 'y' where y will represent Valentina's number of guests in addition to herself for both the laser tag and roller coaster expenses:\n   - Total money spent on Roller Coaster tickets = 1 * (€45) or €45\n10. Since pinball tokens are required, we need to add this expense: \n    - Pinball Token cost = y * €5 where 'y' is Valentina's guests in addition to herself.\n11. Given that her total budget for the party is €290 and she wants to spend money on roller coaster tickets (€45), laser tag per person, pinball tokens for all of them:\n   - Budget constraint equation: 1*(cost of one round * y) + 5*y + x = 290\n12. However we've been told that the number of people will be used in a 'per person' cost for laser tags so our actual budget can be rewritten to figure out how many people (Valentina and her guests): \n   - Budget constraint equation: y * (cost per round) + 5*y + x = 290\n13. We know the total number of roller coaster tickets is five which will take €45.\n14. So let's simplify our budget problem by removing one expense from it:\n- Simplified Budget Constraint Equation for 'y': \n   - y * (cost per round) + 5*y = 290 - 45 or \n    y*(cost of laser tag + cost of pinball tokens)= 245\n15. Because there's no given value to the total amount spent on one player, we will need to make a 'per person' assumption for this problem as it is presented.\n16. The only way our budget constraint equation can be solved with known expenses from roller coaster tickets and pinball token cost - let us figure out how many people were invited by considering both of these costs at once:\n   y * (cost per round + 5) = €245 or \n    y*(8+€5)= €245\n17. Simplifying: y(13) = €245, which implies that we divide the budget constraint equation into two parts to isolate 'y'. The cost of laser tag is unknown and has been left as a variable in our equation.\n18. However since it can be assumed (for this particular question) that all people are spending money on roller coaster tickets or pinball tokens - lets simplify things:\n   y * 13 = €245 \n19. To find 'y', divide both sides by the coefficient of 'y': \n    y=€245 / €13\n20. Simplifying, we get: $18 (or 18)\n21. Since there is an additional guest assumed in this calculation who was spending money for pinball tokens and roller coaster tickets - to answer how many friends can she invite:\n   The total number of people will be the sum of Valentina herself plus her guests.\n22. In other words, if 'y' represents all of Valentina's invited friends: \n    Total Number = 1 (Valentina) + y\n23. Since we know that 'y' is equal to $18:\n   The total",

Since she also wants to play laser tag, we need to add her own cost for a round of laser tag.\n2. The total budget is ¥200, so subtracting Emma's laser tag and roller coaster costs from this will give us our equation: 8 + 18 * x = 200 - 6 (for the pinball tokens).\n3. Simplify the equation by combining like terms on the right side of the equals sign to get: 26x = 194.\n4. Divide both sides of the equation by 26 to isolate 'x', resulting in: x = 7.38461538.\n\nHowever, since we can't invite a fraction of people and Emma will also pay for her own laser tag game (which is ¥8), she must round down to ensure there's enough money left over after buying pinball tokens (£6) as well.\n5.

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. Elena wants to spend money on bowling, game room tokens, and bumper cars rides.\n2. The cost of a round of bowling is $8 per person. Let's represent the number of friends she can invite as 'x'. Then, the total cost for her and x friends will be 190 + 8(x+1) = 190 + 8x + 8 (since Elena also has to pay).\n3. She wants to have $3 in game room tokens.\n4. The bumper cars cost $12 per ride, and she rides them seven times.\n\nThe total amount of money spent on bowling will be the first concern:\n\nTotal spent = Cost for her + cost for x friends\n          = 190 + (8x+8)\n          = 198 + 8x\n\nNext is to consider the game room tokens:\nShe has $3 in game room tokens, and she spends nothing else.\n\nNow we should account for the bumper cars. Since Elena rides them seven times:\n\nTotal spent on bowling and bumpers\n= Cost of riding bumps (7 * $12)\n+ Total cost of playing with friends \n  = 84 + 8x\n\nSince total money available is $190, it must cover both expenses:\n198 + 8x <= 190 \n\nSubtracting the initial amount from each side we have:\n\n8x<= -8\nDividing by 8 on each side gives us x<0 which doesn't make sense because you can invite friends and guests so this isn't a viable path.\n\nLooking back at our equations, there is something wrong in step one. We should include her initial budget before buying game room tokens as the equation:\n190-3 = money left after she buys  $3 worth of tokens\n187 - total spent on bowling = amount Elena has remaining.\nSo let's use this information and find another way to solve for x.\n\n187 +8x= Total cost\n\nWe know that Elena spends on bumpers: \n7 *12=84 \n\nNow, we'll recombine the equation with bumper costs included:\n187+ 8x+84\nLet's combine like terms:\n\n271 +8x = total amount spent by Elena and her friends.\n\nSince she has a budget of $190 for party expenses (not including money used on bumpers), \nand all other things excepting bumpers are already accounted for in the equation:\nWe'll subtract 187 from both sides to isolate term with 'x':\n271+8x - 187 = total amount spent\n            =84 + 8x\n\nSubtracting $271 (which is what she has remaining if no one else attends) gives us her total expenses including bumpers, and we get:\n-88 = Total money used.\n\nThis equation seems impossible to solve as it suggests negative values but that isn't something you can use for guests. This means our initial approach was flawed.\nThe real problem statement is the combination of Elena's spending on bowling (for herself) + her friends and bumpers ride costs equaling $190 or less:\n8x+84= 190\n\nNow, subtracting $84 from both sides to isolate x term gives us: \nTotal spent\n-8x = -86 \n\nDividing by -8 we get our solution for the number of guests she can invite:\n\nAnswer: The final answer is $\\boxed{10.75}$.",

So, in total, they will infect 11 * 3 = 33 new people.\n- Now, we add these newly infected to the initial number of infected people: 11 + 33 = 44.\n\nHowever, since each person who got infected initially also becomes a source for infection on subsequent days (not just Day 1), it's more accurate to consider this as an exponential growth problem. The formula to model such situations is N(t) = N0 * r^t, where:\n- N0 is the initial number of people,\n- r is the rate at which each infected person infects others (in our case, 3),\n- t is time in days.\n\nBut for simplicity and given that we are not explicitly asked to use such formula but rather understand growth through basic multiplication, let's proceed with this simplified approach:\n\nDay 2:\n- Now there are 44 people who could potentially spread the virus.\n- Each of these infects 3 others. So they will infect: \n   - The initial infected (11) * 3 = 33\n   - Those newly infected on Day 1 by them, i.e., those initially counted as not yet infected but became so today because someone got sick and spread the virus to their contacts yesterday.\nHowever since our base number is now actually all previously infected individuals plus new ones created last night (infection initiated before this day), let's look at it from a simpler angle:\n\n   Total newly infected on Day 2 = those who were not yet but are today because someone they know got sick. Since everyone was part of the count in infection yesterday, we can find total number by:\n   - Those initially uninfected plus new ones created due to last day's infections (because each one gets others infected)\nNow considering these calculations will give us accurate results:\n\nTotal newly infected on Day 2 = Total people who were not yet but got infected today\n                            = New ones from previous days + those the current group of infected can infect \nTo simplify this:\nOn the first day, there are initially 11 and then you get new infections due to these initial numbers getting sick.\nNew total at end of Day1: N = (initially uninfected) + newly created\nSo on second day for each person who got infected yesterday, they can infect three others\n\nDay 2:\n- The people from last night are now the ones capable of spreading infection today to new and existing people in their networks.\nTotal at end of Day1 is N. Now we need to add all those newly created.\n\nSo on second day for each person who got infected yesterday, they can infect three others\n\nDay 2:\n- The initial number (11) plus any new ones from last night\nTo calculate this, let's apply the same approach as before but remember these are part of a sequence that continues to grow.\n\n\nFor Day1: \nTotal newly created = Total people initially uninfected + those infected and now can infect others.\n= 33\n\nNow for each person who got infected on day one they will create new infections (infection initiated yesterday)\nSo, let's calculate total number at end of Day2:\n- The initial count was N0. Now we have newly created people from last night’s infection \n   - These are those who were not yet but became part because someone in their network got infected.\n\nNewly Created on second day: Total uninfected = 11 + previous infections\nLet's say previously infected number is Y, which means the total count at end of Day1 becomes N0(Y) and that includes newly created due to last night’s infection\n\nAt the start (Day 1):\n- The initial people who got infected yesterday were those not yet but are now.\n   - This gives a new set of infections today\nNow let's find out how many there will be on Day2: \nSince each person can infect others:\nNewly created due to last night’s infection is Y. Each one gets 3 more, i.e., total newly infected = 3Y\n\nSo we need the value for 'Y' which represents those who were not yet but are now because someone they know got sick.\nWe have an equation here and can solve it.\n\nAt end of Day1: Total count\n= N0 + New ones due to initial infection yesterday (i.e., Y)\nNow at end of day2 the total will be:\nTotal = 11 + Y + newly created today \n   - Newly created is those who were not yet but got infected on this particular day.\n\nTo find 'Y', let's use what we know.
