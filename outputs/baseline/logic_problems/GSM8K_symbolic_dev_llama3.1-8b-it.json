Since there are 8 remoras attached to the dolphin:\n   - Multiply the number of remoras (8) with their individual length in feet (since we're comparing lengths, convert everything into a common unit). \n     So each Remora is approximately 0.25 ft long since 1 foot = 12 inches and 3/12=0.25.\n   - Total combined length of the 8 remoras: 8 * 0.25 ft = 2 feet\n3. Convert both lengths into a common unit (feet) for comparison:\n   - Dolphin's body length: 10 feet\n   - Combined length of all 8 remoras: 2 feet\n4.

Of these, 3 outcomes (4, 5, and 6) are greater than 3. So the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:\n\nP(greater_than_3) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total possible outcomes\n= 3/6\n= 1/2\n\n**Probability of Rolling Two Odd Numbers in a Row:**\n\nThere are two possibilities for the first roll (odd or even), and if it's odd, there are three possibilities for the second roll (also odd). So the probability of rolling an odd number on both rolls is:\n\nP(both_odd) = P(first_roll_odd) * P(second_roll_odd)\n= 3/6 * 2/6\n= 1/6\n\n**Comparing Probabilities:**\n\nNow, we need to compare these two probabilities.

Now we need to find out how many students in total are either into hiking or painting (or both). We know that there are a total of 157 students.\n\n3.

      "raw": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.\n\n1. First, let's find out how many students like either hiking or playing music:\n   Total number of students = 162\n   Number that like dance and basketball = 14 + 42 = 56\n   \n2. Now subtract the total number of students who like dancing and basketball from the total to get those who hike/play music.\n   Students who like hiking/music = Total - (Students who like dance or Basketball)\n   Students who like hiking/music = 162 - 56\n   Students who like hiking/music = 106\n   \n3. The problem also states that twice as many students prefer playing basketball than the number of people who play music:\n   Let x be the number of students who like to hike.\n   Then, (x + y) is the total for those who either hike or play music\n   Since we already know this value from step 2: \n   We also have that twice as many prefer basketball than music. This means if there are 'y' people in music then there will be '2*y' students playing Basketball.\n   Now, since all the students are accounted for:\n   So (x + y) = Total - Students who like dance or basketball\n   From step 1 we know that: \n    x+y=106\n   \n4. We also have another relationship from our problem statement where twice as many prefer to play basketball than music.\n   This can be written in an equation form:\n   \n   (x + y) = Total - Students who like dance or Basketball\n   From step 1 we know that: \n    x+y=106\n   \n5. Also, number of students playing basketball is equal to twice the number of people who play Music:\n   So, 2y = 42 [Since there are 42 people in Basketball]\n   \n6. Now solve for y which represents those who like music.\n   From step 3: \n    We have that 2*y=42\n   \n7. Solve this equation to find the number of students playing basketball (in terms of 'y'):\n   Divide both sides by two:\n     y = 21\n8. Since we've found out how many people enjoy Music, let's now calculate those who like hiking.\n    We already know that x+y=106 from step 4\n9. Plug the value for \"y\" into this equation to find 'x'\n   Substitute in our known values:\n     x+21 = 106\n\n10. Solve this new equation to determine how many students enjoy Hiking (in terms of 'x'):\n    Subtract 21 from both sides to isolate 'x':\n      x=85",

Calculate the amount of sugar she used in teaspoonfuls:\n   Since Leilani uses a ratio of 112:43 for sugar and water, respectively, out of every 155 parts (total), 112 are teaspoons of sugar.\n\nNow let's do some math:\n\n1. Divide total number of teaspoons by total number of parts to find 'x':\n   \n   x = Total Number Of Teaspoons / Total Number Of Parts\n   x = 1240 / 155\n   \n2. Now calculate the amount of sugar in teaspoonfuls:\n   \n   Amount Of Sugar In Teaspoonfuls = (112/155) * 1240\n\nLet's do some math:\n\nx ≈ 8 \n\nAmount Of Sugar In Teaspoonfuls ≈ ((112)/155)*1240\n≈ (112*1240)/(155)\n≈ 140608 / 155 \n≈ 906.91",

We can simplify this ratio by dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which in this case is 2:\n\nSimplified Ratio = 14:27\n\nHowever, we will keep the original ratio for clarity.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total parts**\nThe total number of parts in the given ratio is:\nTotal Parts = Sugar + Water\n= 28 + 54 (as per problem statement)\n= 82\n\nAlternatively, using our simplified ratio from step 1,\nwe can also calculate Total Parts as \nTotal Parts = 14+27 = 41. However since we have to use original numbers for calculation of total parts used, so it will be 82.\n\n**Step 3: Find the value of one part**\nNow that we know there are a total of 574 teaspoons (sugar and water combined), let's find out how many teaspoonfuls each \"part\" represents:\n\nValue per Part = Total Amount / Total Parts\n= 574 / 82\n\nHowever, in this case it is simpler to just divide both parts by their GCD i.e.2.\nThen the equation becomes,\n Value per part = (28 +54) / 2 \n                 = 41/1\n**Step 4: Find out how many teaspoonfuls of sugar Tara used**\nNow that we know each \"part\" represents a certain number of teaspoons, let's find out how much sugar she used by multiplying the value per part with her actual amount (28 parts):\n\nSugar Amount = Value per Part * Sugar Parts\n             = 41/1 * 14 \n**Step 5: Perform final calculation**\nNow we have everything to calculate Tara's total amount of sugar.\nSugar Amount = 574 /82 * 28\n\nHowever, for simplicity let us just multiply both the parts by GCD i.e.2 and then divide it with value per part (41).\nSo our equation becomes,\n Sugar Amount= (28*14) /(54/27)\n              =(392)/(2)\n\nNow we can perform final calculation.\nSugar Amount = 196",

The given ratio is 28:24.\n\nStep 1: Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 28 and 24.\nThe factors of 28 are: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28\nThe factors of 24 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\n\nStep 2: The greatest common divisor (GCD) is the highest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.\nFrom step 1, we can see that GCD(28, 24) = 4.\n\nStep 3: Divide each part of the ratio by the GCD to find the total number of parts in one set.\nWe have two sets with 28 and 24 as their respective values. After dividing both numbers by 4 (GCD), we get:\nSet1 : 7\nSet2 : 6\n\nStep 4: Add these values together to determine how many \"sets\" are there, which will represent a full combination of the ratio.\nTotal number of sets = Set1 + Set2 \n= 7 + 6\n= 13\n\nThe total parts in one set is now known as (28/4) and (24/4), or more simply put: 7 for sugar, 6 for water.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the amount used per \"set\" of ratio.\nTotal teaspoons = Total number of sets * value of each part\n= 13 * 1352 / (7 + 6)\nTo find total parts first we add both values together to get a complete set. So it is \n(28/4) + (24/4).\nTherefore, the correct formula for calculating total teaspoons should be: \n\nTotal Teaspoons = Total number of sets * value of each part\n= 13 * (1352 / 4)\n\nStep 6: Now calculate how many \"sets\" are used from Nadia.\nTotal Sets Used = Total parts in ratio \n= 7 + 6\n\nNow, we need to divide the total amount by this sum. However since it is already divided into sets as per step 3:\nTherefore,\nTo find out teaspoons of sugar she uses: \n\nTeaspoons Of Sugar She Uses\n= (Total Parts / Sets Used) * Amount In Each Set \n= ((28 + 24)/4 )/13 * 1352",

This is not a continuous process, but rather an event that occurs at specific intervals.\n\nSince there are two harvesting periods in one year (every 6 months), \nthe number of actual harvests = Total number of harvesting periods\n= 2\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total pomegranates Oliver can harvest within a year**\n\nTo calculate this, we need to multiply the total number of pomegranates by how many times Oliver gets to harvest.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\nTotal pomegranates = Total number of pomegranates * Actual harvesting periods\n= (90 * 45) * 2\n\n**Step 5: Simplify and solve**\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\nFirst, multiply 90 by 45.\n90 * 45 = 4050\n\nThen, multiply the result by 2:\n4050 * 2 = 8100",

There are also 30 multicolored rings on the tower.\n\nTo find out how many bouncy balls there were, we need to subtract all the other toys from the total number:\n\nTotal number of toys = Number of building blocks + Number of stuffed animals + Number of stacking rings + Number of bouncy balls\n238 = 71 + 47 + 30 + x\n\nNow let's solve for x by first adding up all known values and then subtracting that sum from the total to find out how many bouncy balls there are:\n\nx = Total number of toys - (Number of building blocks + Number of stuffed animals + Number of stacking rings)\n= 238 - (71 + 47 + 30)\n\nFirst, let's add up all known values:\n(71 + 47) = 118\nThen we need to include the multicolored rings as well.\nSo now it is: \n118 + 30 = 148\n\nNow that we know this sum of other toys (which equals 148), we can find x by subtracting from total number of toys:\nx = Total - Sum of known values\n= 238 - 148\n\nLet's do the math for subtraction.\n238- 148 = 90 \n\nTherefore, there are \\boxed{90} bouncy balls in the tube.",

Calculate how much of a single table's capacity is taken by Esteban:\n   With 21 being divisible into 236 (which it isn't), but if you divide 236/21 then you get 11 with remainder, hence we know that all tables will not be fully utilized.\n\n4.

Feeling generous tomorrow she will give away some of these to friends and family, specifically 7 potted plants from each ledge (55 window ledges in total)\n    Total number given is:\n     Number of Window Ledges * Potted Plants per ledge to be distributed.\n     This equals: \n     = 55 * 7\n     = 385\n\n4. Now we need the final amount after Gabrielle gives away those potted plants, so we subtract them from total now (594):\n   Final Amount will equal:\n    Total Now - Number Distributed\n      = 594 - 385\n       = **209**\n\nSo, Gabrielle remains with \\boxed{209} potted plants.",

Then her speed on the sidewalk is 2x kilometers per minute (since she walks at two times the rate).\n\nStep 2:\nWe know that in one hour (60 minutes), Mia covers a certain distance while walking on the beach, and another distance while walking on the sidewalk.\n\nLet's find out how much time it takes for her to cover each part of the trail. We can start with the information given:\n\n- Time spent on the beach = 60 minutes\nDistance covered in this time = Speed x Time = (x) * (60)\n\nSince she walks a total distance of 12 kilometers, we know that:\n(x) * (60) = 12\n\nStep 3: \nNow let's find out how much speed Mia has on the beach. We can do this by dividing both sides of our equation by 60.\n\nx = 12 / 60\nx = 0.2 km/min \n\nThis is her walking speed in kilometers per minute while she walks on the beach.\n\nStep 4: \nNow let's find out how much time it takes for Mia to cover the entire trail, including both parts of the walk (beach and sidewalk).\n\nThe total distance covered by Mia = Distance on Beach + Distance on Sidewalk\n= 12 km + 12 km\n\nTime taken to cover this distance is:\nTotal Time = Total Distance / Speed \n\nSpeed here should be in kilometers per minute for consistency. Since she walks at two times the rate, speed of sidewalk becomes (2 * x) which equals 0.4.\n\nTherefore,\nTotal time = (24 km)/(0.4)\n\nStep 5: \nTo get our final answer we can now simply calculate this value:\n\nTime taken by Mia to complete her entire walk = Total Time\n= 60 minutes\n\nSo, the total duration of walking is \\boxed{60} minutes",

Since she walks at two times her beach speed on the sidewalk, her sidewalk speed is 2x MPM.\n\nWe know that distance = rate × time. Therefore:\n\nBeach: 12 miles = x * t_beach\nSidewalk: 13 miles = 2x * t_sidewalk\n\nwhere t_beach and t_sidewalk are the times spent on each part of her walk in minutes, respectively.\n\nStep 2: Use given information to determine time for beach portion of walk.\n\nWe know that Fatima spends a total of 48 minutes walking on the beach. Therefore:\n\nt_beach = 48\n\nNow we can find x by substituting this into our equation from step 1:\n12 = x * t_beach\nx = (12/48) MPM\nx = 0.25 MPM\n\n\nStep 3: Find time for sidewalk portion of walk.\n\nWe now know Fatima's beach speed is 0.25 miles per minute and her sidewalk speed is twice that, or 2 * 0.25 = 0.5 MP/M.\nNow we can use this to find t_sidewalk:\n13 = 0.5 MPM × t_sidewalk\nt_sidewalk = (13/0.5) minutes \nt_sidewalk ≈ 26\n\nStep 4: Find the total time for her entire walk.\n\nThe beach portion of Fatima's walk takes approximately 48 minutes, and she also spends about 26 more walking on the sidewalk.\nTotal Time = t_beach + t_sidewalk\n= (48) + (26)\n≈ 74\n\nTherefore, it will take approximately **boxed{74}** minutes for her to complete her entire 25-mile walk.",

To convert this to hours, divide by 60:\n\n48 / 60 = 0.8 hours (on the beach)\n\nSince her speed is constant and we are given a specific distance covered at each location, let's proceed with finding out how much time Rania spends walking on the sidewalk.\n\nStep 2: Determine the rate of speed for both locations.\nGiven that she covers 18 kilometers in one segment where as she walks 12 km in another. We can calculate her speeds by dividing distances covered to respective segments:\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\n\nOn beach, Speed_Beach = 12 Km / (0.8 hours) \n= 15Km/h \n\nSince we are given that Rania's speed on the sidewalk is three times faster than it is on the beach:\nSpeed_Sidewalk = Speed_Beach * 3\n= 45 km/h\n\nStep 3: Determine how much time she spends walking on the sidewalk.\nWe know her total walk distance (30 kilometers) and we also have speeds for both segments. Given that Rania walks at a speed of 15Km/ hour in one segment, let's find out the remaining part i.e., Sidewalk:\n\nSidewalk_Distance = Total Walk - Beach Distance\n= 30 km - 12 Km \n= 18 kilometers\n\nTime_Sidewalk = Sidewalk_Distance / Speed_Sidewalk \n= (18Km) / (45km/h)\n= 0.4 hours \n\nStep 4: Convert the time spent walking on the sidewalk to minutes.\nTo convert from hours to minutes, multiply by 60:\n\nTime_Sidewalk_minutes = Time_Sidewalk * 60\n= (0.4 hours)*60 \n= 24 minutes\n\nSince Rania spends a total of 48 + 24 = 72 minutes walking on both the beach and sidewalk.\n\nTherefore,\n\\boxed{72}",

Now, we need to find out how many questions in total Haruka is sure of getting right.\n   Total_correct_answers = Economics_questions + Algebra_and_History_questions \n                          = Correct_Economics + Correct_Algebra_and_History  \n                           = (19) + (20)\n                           = 39 \n\nTherefore, the answer is: \\boxed{39}",

To find out how many watermelons Ali has picked so far, we simply have the two numbers: 290 and 389.\n\nNow let's consider Thursday:\n4.

That is Tuesday's + Wednesday's.\n- Then multiply the result from above with two (double)\n- The final answer would then equal:\nTuesday's+Wednesday's + Thursday's\n\nLet us write it in code to make sure we're doing this right:\n\n```python\ntuesday = 290 # Watermelons picked on tuesday \nwednesday = 389 #watermelon picked on wednesday \n\n# We need the amount of watermelons that were already picked.

      "raw": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.\n\n1. On Tuesday and Wednesday, Bodhi watched a 6-hour episode each night for two nights:\n   - Total hours on these days = 2 * 6 = 12 hours\n2. We don't know how many episodes of the 45-minute show he watched yet.\n3. Let's represent the number of episodes as x.\n\nOn Thursday, Bodhi watched a few (x) episodes of this 45-minute show:\n- Total minutes on these days for each episode is: 0.75 * x\n   - Since there are only two shows we know about that have a specific time frame so far.\n4. On Friday, he finished homework early and watched one 3-hour episode (3 hours) and another 45-minute show:\n- Total minutes on this day for the known episodes is: 180 + 0.75 = 181\n   - We already know two of his shows' times now.\n\nOn Saturday, Bodhi got to stay up late so he watched five 2-hour episodes (5 * 120):\n- Total hours on these days = 600\n\nNow we have all the information needed and can calculate how many total minutes of TV Bodhi watched:\n   - We know that there are only two shows with specific time frames, one is a constant at 0.75x + 181.\n   - The other show has no variable so it's just (2 * 6) hours = 12 hours.\n\nTotal minutes he watched on Tuesday and Wednesday: \n- Total minutes for these days is the same as total hours because there are only two shows that we know have specific times, which both equal to an hour.\n   - So they're equivalent in our calculations. We now need to get rid of this variable since it makes no difference.\n\nTotal hours Bodhi watched = 12 + (0.75x) + 3 + 181 + 600\nNow convert the total number of minutes he has into a decimal, \n- This is done by dividing each term in our equation:\n   - We now have: 28 * 60 \n\nWe can multiply both sides to get rid of any variables we don't want.\nThis will give us:\n\n(12 + (0.75x) + 3 + 181 + 600)* 60 = 1680\nNow, let's combine the constants:\n- This is now: \n   - We have ((12 + 3 + 181 + 600 ) * 60)\n= 896*60 \n\nWe can simplify this expression by multiplying out all of its terms. Then we get:\n\n896*60 = 53760\n\nNow, let's subtract the known value from both sides:\n- This will give us: \n   - We have (0.75x) * 60\nNow multiply to isolate x and find how many episodes Bodhi watched.\n\nWe know that there are two constants now so we can just plug them in.\n(53760 - 53760)/60 = .75\n\nThis is equal to:\n- This gives us: \n   (0.75x) * 60/60\nNow divide both sides by the variable, and you get:\n\n(x)=2",

      "raw": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of time Sanjay watched TV and then subtract that from 30 hours. We can start by calculating how many minutes are in each type of show.\n\n- A 5-hour episode is equal to 300 minutes (5 x 60).\n- A 15-minute episode is what we're trying to find out.\n- The total time for a 45-minute show on Friday.\n- Each 3-hour episode has 180 minutes.\n\nNow, let's calculate the amount of TV Sanjay watched each night:\n\n1. Tuesday and Wednesday: (2 nights x 300 minutes/night) = 600 minutes\n2. Thursday: Let's assume he watches 'x' number of episodes on Thursday. Since we don't know how many shows he watched yet, we can leave it as a variable.\n3. Friday:\n   - The time for the 6-hour episode is (360 minutes).\n   - We already have the information about a 45-minute show.\n\n4. Saturday: \n    - Sanjay watches four episodes of 180 minutes each so that's 720 minutes in total\n\nNow, let's calculate how much TV he watched on Friday and Saturday:\n- Total time for shows other than Thursday is (600 + 360) = 960.\n- Adding the Saturday night to it we get: \n(960+720)=1680 \n\nSanjay watched a total of 30 hours or 1800 minutes. If he had not watched any TV on Thursday, then his total would have been:\n- Total time for shows other than Thursday (as calculated above) is 1680.\nSo the actual amount that was watched by him in place of it must be: \n(1800 - 1680)=120\n\nSince we are asked to find out how many episodes he watched on Thursday, let's calculate 'x' now:\n- Each episode has a length of (15 minutes), so if Sanjay had not watched any TV on Thursday then the total would have been\n(360+720) =1080 \nNow subtracting it from 120 we get:  \n120 - 1080=960",

Calculate the total hours of TV watched on Thursday and Friday:\n   Since Qasim watched a 4-hour episode each night for two nights (Thursday and Friday), he watched: \n   2 * 4 = 8 hours\n\n2. On Sunday, he finished homework early and watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show.\n   First convert the 45 minutes to hours:\n   Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide by 60 to get: \n   45 / 60 = 0.75 hours\n   So on Sunday he watched (3 + 0.75) hours of TV.\n\n3. Now let's calculate the total number of hours Qasim has already accounted for:\n   We know that in addition to Thursday and Friday, we need to add the hours from Sunday.\n   Total so far: \n   8 + (3 + 0.75) = 11.75\n\n4. On Monday, he got to stay up late, so he watched five 3-hour episodes:\n   We can multiply by 5 since there are five episodes and each episode is 3 hours long.\n   So on Monday: \n   5 * 3 = 15 hours\n   Add this to the total from previous nights. Now we have a new running total of TV time watched in hours:\n   Total so far (including Monday): \n   11.75 + 15 = 26.75\n\n5. The problem states that Qasim watched 28 hours of TV in all.\n   We know how much he has already accounted for, which is: \n   26.75\n   Subtract this from the total amount to find out how many more hours are left:\n   28 - 26.75 = 1.25\n\n6. Now we have a new problem; Qasim watched some episodes on Saturday that were each 15 minutes long.\n   First convert these 15-minute shows into hours by dividing by 60 (since there's one hour in sixty minutes):\n   So, for every episode of the show: \n   15 / 60 = 0.25\n   Since Qasim watched some episodes on Saturday we can multiply this number to find out how many he has accounted for.\n   We know that these are all his unaccounted hours (1.25). Now let's divide by .25 to get the total number of TV shows:\n   Number of 15-minute episodes: \n   1.25 / 0.25 = 5\n\nTherefore, Qasim watched \\boxed{5} 15-minute episodes on Saturday.\n\nPlease note that I followed your instructions and solved it step-by-step as requested!",

On Tuesday:\n   - He watched a 6-hour (or 360 minutes) episode.\n   - And then 45 minutes show\n   - So total time on this day = (1*360) + (45/60)\n   \n4. On Wednesday:\n   - Oscar watched four episodes of his favorite TV show, each lasting for 4 hours or 240 minutes.\n   - Total time spent watching these shows is: \n     4 * 240 = 960\n\n5. Now we have total watchtime in minutes as (720 + 15x) + 405 + 960\n6. We can write the equation to find x:\n   720 + 15x + 405 + 960 = 29*60 \n7. Simplify it by first adding all constants on one side:  \n      1085 + 15x = 1740\n\n8. Solve for 'x':\n     Subtracting 1085 from both sides of the equation:\n       15x = (1740 - 1085)\n         x = ((1740-1085)/15)\n\n9. Calculate it\n   x = (655/15) \n10 Now calculate this value to get our final answer.\n\nNow let's put in python code for these steps\n\n```python",

Her husband also gave her 18 more spoons from his own purchase.\n3. Later, Emma used 10 spoons to sample her stuffed peppers.\n4. At this point, the total number of spoons is not known, so let's call the initial package size x.\n\nWe know that after buying a new package (x) and receiving 18 more spoons from her husband, but before using any of them for sampling or setting the table, Emma had:\n\n   Total = Initial Package Size + Spoons Received\n         = x + 18\n\nHowever we are told she ends up with 30 spoons after using some.\n\n5. Since Emma used 10 spoons to sample and then set the table (with a total of 30 spoons), let's subtract those 10 spoons from her final count:\n\n   Initial Package Size + Spoons Received - Used = Final Count\n   x + 18 - 10 = 30\n\nNow we can solve for x.\n\n6. Simplify the equation by combining like terms:\n \n    x + 8 = 30\n   \n7. Subtract 8 from both sides to isolate x:\n\n     x = 22\n\n\nTherefore, Emma's initial package of spoons had **{**\\boxed{22}**}** spoons in it.\n\nThis result makes sense because if she bought a new package with 20 or fewer spoons and received an additional 18 (totaling less than 40), then after using some for sampling, the final total would be too low.",

Determine how many more calories you can consume to reach your daily calorie target:\n   Daily Calorie Target - Consumed Calories\n                                = 2395 - 1350\n                                = 1045\n\n3. Calculate the fraction of total calories that represents your remaining daily calorie target:\n   Remaining Fraction = (Remaining Calories / Total Calories) * Number of Servings\n                      = ((1045 / 2375) * 275)\n\n4. Now, we need to calculate how many ounces can be eaten with the remaining calories.\n   Since there are 5 servings in a bag and each serving has its own specific calorie count,\n   let's find out which fraction of the total amount is represented by your daily target:\n   First, divide the number of servings (which you have already consumed or will consume) \n   from the initial value to determine how many ounces you can eat for 1 day.\n   \n   Remaining Calories / Total calories per bag\n = 1045/2375 * 275\n\nNow calculate:\n\nRemaining Calories / Total calories per bag  \n                                = (1045 / 2375)\n                                ≈ .4409 \n\nSince the number of servings is a factor in determining how many ounces you can eat,\nyou need to multiply this by total amount:\n   Now, we have: \n   Remaining Amount\n                            = (.4409 * 275)",

First, we need to find the brokerage fee which is 7% of the selling price.\n   The selling price = $400000\n   Brokerage Fee = (selling_price * brokerage_percentage) / 100 \n   brokerage_fee = ($400000 * 7)/100\n\n2. Calculate the transfer fee that is 14% of the selling price.\n   Transfer Fee = (selling_price * transfer_percentage) / 100 \n   transfer_fee = ($400000 * 14)/100 \n\n3.

Calculate the actual values of brokerage fee and transfer fee using step 1 & 2 results:\n   brokerage_fee = ($400000 * 7)/100 \n                  = (400000*7) / 100 \n                  = 28000 \n\n   transfer_fee = ($400000 * 14)/100\n                  = (400000*14) / 100 \n                  = 56000\n\n5. Now, let's calculate the total cost for Mrs. Lee using step 3 and actual values of brokerage fee and transfer fee:\n   Total Cost = Selling Price + Brokerage Fee + Transfer Fee\n               = $400000 + 28000 + 56000\n               = $404000 \n\n6. Finally, we need to determine how much more the total price is than Mrs. Lee's budget.\n   Difference in cost = Total Cost - Budget \n                       = $404000 - $470000\n\nNow let's calculate this difference:\ndifference_in_cost = ($404000 - 470000)/1\n                   = -66000 \n\nSo, we need to put a negative sign around the result since it is less than her budget.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-66000}$",

    "logic_problem": {
      "raw": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the total price of the townhouse and compare it with Mrs. Lee's budget.\n\n1. The selling price is $390000.\n2. The brokerage fee is 6% of the selling price:\n   Brokerage Fee = Selling Price * (Brokerage Percentage / 100)\n                 = $390,000 * (6/100)\n                 = $23,400\n3. The transfer fee is 13% of the selling price:\n   Transfer Fee = Selling Price * (Transfer Percentage / 100)\n                  = $390,000 * (13/100)\n                  = $50,700\n\n4. Now we can find out the total cost by adding all three costs together.\n   Total Cost = Selling Price + Brokerage Fee + Transfer Fee\n                = $390,000 + $23,400 + $50,700\n                = $464,100\n\n5. Finally, let's calculate how much more than Mrs. Lee's budget is the total cost:\n   Difference = Total Cost - Budget\n                 = $464,100 - $410,000\n                 = $54,100\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\boxed{$54100}",

      "raw": "\n\nTo solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. First, we need to calculate the transfer fees that Mr. Johnson paid:\n   Transfer Fees = 2% of $770000\n                 = (2/100) * 770000\n                 = $15400\n\n2. Next, we'll calculate the brokerage fee he paid:\n   Brokerage Fee = 3% of $770000\n                  = (3/100) * 770000\n                  = $23100\n\n3. Now, let's find out how much Mr. Johnson received after paying these two fees:\n   Amount Received After Fees = Selling Price - Transfer Fees - Brokerage Fee\n                              = $770000 - $15400 - $23100\n                              = $736500\n\n4. Finally, we need to subtract the remaining loan amount from this amount to find out how much Mr. Johnson's net proceeds are:\n   Net Proceeds = Amount Received After Fees - Remaining Loan Amount\n                = $736500 - $580000\n                = $156500\n\nSo, the result is:\n\n\\boxed{$156500}",

Mini cupcakes: $88 per dozen (7 dozens is 7 x $88 = $616)\n3. Mini cheesecakes: $116 per dozen\n\nNow we need to calculate the total cost:\n- The donut price isn't needed because she bought only one dozen for 1 *13.\n- She purchased seven dozen cupcakes at a rate of $88 each, which is calculated as (7*88).\n- Then six dozens cheesecakes were also acquired from Kayla. This amount will be found by multiplying the value of one dozen ($116) and then multiply that number with 6.\n\nAdding all these values together should give us our final answer:\n\n1 *13 + (7*88) + (6*$116)\n\nFirst, let's do the multiplication:\n- $13\n- 616\n- 696\n\nNow we add them up to get the total cost:\n$13 + $616 = $629 \nThen add that value with another number ($96)\n$629 + $696 = $1325 \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1325}$",

Calculate the total number of floors cleaned per day:\n- It takes them 20 minutes to clean one floor, so they can clean 1 / 0.3333 (or 300) floors every minute.\n- Multiply this by their work time in a day: 30 * 10 = 600.\n\nHowever we calculated that the worker cleans 600 floors per day and there are 210 floors total; therefore it takes them exactly 3 days to clean all of these, not ten. This is an error on our part because we made assumptions about how much time they had available when in fact we don't know this at all.\n\nThe correct method would be:\n- Total number of minutes spent cleaning = (Total floors / Floors cleaned per minute) * 60\n= (210 / 300) * 60 \n= .7 * 600\n=420\n\n2.

Next, we need to calculate the time spent cleaning all floors:\n   - Time per floor is given as 30 minutes\n   - Total number of floors is 120\n   - Therefore, total time taken to clean all floors is (30 * 120) / 60 minutes since there are 60 minutes in an hour.\n   - This can be simplified: \n     First convert the fraction into a decimal by dividing numerator with denominator. Then multiply it by multiplier of the numerator which is 30 and then divide that result by 10\n   - Total time = (120/60) * (30/1)\n   - Since we are working in minutes, let's simplify further: \n     First calculate fraction part i.e., 120 / 60.

Calculate the total number of minutes spent cleaning all rooms:\n   - The janitor has to clean 135 rooms.\n   - It takes them 30 minutes per room.\n   So, they will spend: 135 * 30 = 4050 minutes in total.\n\n2. Convert their daily working hours into minutes:\n   - They work for 15 hours each day.\n   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.\n   So, the janitor works for (15 * 60) = 900 minutes per day.\n\n3. Calculate how many days they have to clean all rooms:\n   - The building has to be cleaned within 5 days.\n   \n4. Now we can calculate total working time over the entire period of cleaning\n    Total Working Time: Number Of Days To Clean In * Daily Work Hours \n                       = (900/60) * 5  \n                       = 75 hours, which is equivalent to \n                        (75*60)=4500 minutes\n\n5. Calculate how much percentage of their day they spend on average cleaning rooms:\n   - They work for a total of 4500 minutes over the entire period.\n   - This time will be distributed across all days and hence we need to divide by number of working days\n     Total Time Spent Cleaning Rooms / (Total Working Days * Daily Work Hours)\n    = 4050/(75) \n    = 54 \n\n6. Finally, convert this into percentage:\n   Since there are 100 minutes in an hour,\n   We can say that one day is equivalent to 60*24=1440 minutes.\n   Percentage of Day Spent Cleaning Rooms\n     = (Total Time Spent Cleaning / Total Working Days * Daily Work Hours) \n       ×(1/1440)\n    ≈ 54/1440 \n    ≈ .0375 or approximately 3.75%\n\nTherefore, the percentage is \\boxed{3.75%}.",

First, we calculate how much money that weight would have been at the regular price\n         b. That's 1kg times the original price per kilogram of cotton candy, which equals ¥21.\n      c. So for four thirds kilograms (or sixteen fifths), it is 4/3 * ¥21 = ¥28 \n     d. The discount on this amount would be: ¥28 - ((16 /5) * ¥11.75)\n         e. First calculate the value of 16 / 5 times ¥11.75\n             f. That equals (16 * ¥11.75)/ 5 which is equal to 188/5 = ¥37.6\n     g.

      "raw": "\n\nTo solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. Xena has ₺1400 initially.\n2. She buys 23 kgs of saltwater taffy at a price that is not entirely clear from the text; however, we can infer:\n   - For every 15 kgs she buys at full price (₺23 per kg), she gets 4 kgs for half off.\n   - Since Xena bought 23 kgs in total and it's an odd number of kilograms that isn't a multiple of the base package size, we can assume:\n     * She must have purchased one complete set (\"Buy 15 kgs at ₺23 per kg\") which gives her 4 free kgs.\n   - Thus, she has to pay for 19 out of 23 kgs (the remaining after buying a full pack) and get the rest half off.\n\n3. Calculate how much saltwater taffy Xena bought that wasn't discounted:\n   * Total weight: 23 kg\n   * Full package discount included in total, so we just need to find the price of non-discounted part which is (15 +4=)19 kgs.\n   - Price for this amount = ₺(23/1kg)*19kgs = ₺437\n\n4. Calculate how much saltwater taffy Xena bought that was discounted:\n   * Discount applied to 4 kg of it\n   - Original price: (₺23/kg) * 4 kgs = ₺92 \n   - Price after discounting half off is: (1/2)*₺92= ₺46\n\n5. Total cost for the saltwater taffy:\n   - Cost at full price + Discounted part\n   - ₺437+₺46= ₺483 \n\n6. Calculate how much she spent on other items.\n   * A mixed bag of starfish: ₺11,50 \n   * 14 keychains that are each ₺21,25:\n     (1) For the price of one item:  $21,25\n     (2) Total number of these items purchased is 14.\n     Price for all items = $(21.25*14)=₺298\n\n7. Now let's calculate her total expenses by summing up everything she bought:\n   * ₺483 + ₺11,50 + ₺298=₺792,5 \n\n8. Calculate how much money Xena has left.\n   - Initial amount: $1400\n   - Total spent on items:  $792,5 \n   Resulting in the following calculation to find out remaining funds:\n    (1) Subtract total expenses from initial fund amount = ₺(1400-792,50)=₺607.5\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{607.5}$.",

      "raw": "\n\nTo solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of rock candy:**\n   - For 15 pounds at $22 per pound: `15 * 22 = $330`\n   - To find out how much she paid for the remaining 8 pounds (23 total pounds minus 15), we need to first calculate what would be half-off.\n   - The discount on 6 pounds is `2/3` off. This means that instead of paying full price, Kimia pays `(1-2/3)` or `1/3` of the original cost for those 6 pounds. \n   First we need to find out what a third is in decimal form: `2 / (3 * 2) = .333`. Then multiply by $22.\n   - `.333 x $22 = $7.33`\n   \n   Now, let's calculate how much she would have paid for the full price of those pounds and then subtract that number from it to get her actual cost: `6 * ($22-$7.33) = 90`. \n   We now add this amount with what we already calculated before (`330 + $90`), but since we only need a third, not all six, for the discount of our pounds, let's subtract those extra dollars from that total so she doesn't get charged for it: `330 - (6 * 7.33)`. Subtracting gives us `$264`.\n   The final cost is $264.\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of sea glass and stickers:**\n   - Sea Glass costs: `$11.75`\n   - Stickers cost: `17 x $21.25 = $362.75`\n\n3. **Add up all expenses to find total spent money:**\n   - Total Spent Money on Rock Candy, Sea Glass & Stickers = ($264 + $11.75) + (17 * 22)\n   To get that last amount we already calculated earlier (`330`), and now add `11.75`. The result is `$275.75`.\n   \n4. **Calculate Kimia's remaining money:**\n   - Initial Money = `$1300`\n   - Total Spent Money on Rock Candy, Sea Glass & Stickers = `$275.75`\n\nNow we subtract the total amount spent from her initial money to get how much she has left.\n\n`$ 1300 - $ 275.75 = $1024.25`\n\nSo Kimia has **$\\boxed{1024.25}$** dollars remaining after shopping at the beach shop and buying sea glass, stickers, and rock candy",

First, we need to determine how much flour Benjamin needs for a week:\n   - He uses 2 kilograms of flour per day.\n   - There are 7 days in a week (Monday through Sunday).\n   \n   So the total amount of flour needed is: \n   Total_flour = 2 kg/day * 7 days/week\n                 = 14 kg\n\n2. Now we need to determine how much more expensive the new brand of flour was:\n   - The normal price per kilogram is ¥5.\n   - The more expensive brand costs 40% more than that.\n\nTo find 40% of a number, multiply by 0.4 (since 100% = 1 and 40% = 0.4). Then add the result to the original number:\n\n   More_expensive_price_per_kg\n     = ¥5 + (¥5 * 0.4)\n     = ¥5 + ¥2\n     = ¥7 per kilogram\n\n3. Now that we know how much more expensive each brand is, let's determine what Benjamin spent on flour:\n   - The normal price was ¥5/ kg.\n   - He bought a total of 14 kilograms (from step 1).\n   \n   So the cost at this price would be: \n   Cost_normal_price = ¥5/kg * 14kg\n                       = ¥70\n\nHowever, he actually paid more since it's a different brand:\n\n   More_expensive_cost_per_kg = ¥7 per kilogram.\n                               - The same as in step 2.\n\nNow let's find the total cost of flour:\nTotal_flour_cost = Cost_normal_price + (Cost_normal_price * 0.4)\n                  = ¥70 + (£70 * £0.40) \n                  = ¥70 + $28\n                 = ¥98\n\n4. Benjamin also decided to buy a muffin for ¥3.\n   - The cost of the flour was calculated in step 3.\n\nTo find out how much everything costs, add these two amounts together:\nTotal_cost = Total_flour_cost (from step 3) \n           + Cost_of_muffin\n             = ¥98 \n               + ¥3 \n             = ¥101\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{¥101}$",

Now, we need to find the price of the more expensive flour that costs 35% more:\n   Let's first calculate what 35% is as an actual number by converting it into decimal form.\n   35 % in decimal form is (35 / 100) or .35\n   The cost per kilogram for his favorite brand was $20. We need to add the value that represents a 35% increase, which we calculated earlier (.35). \n   Cost of more expensive flour = 20 + (20 * .35)\n   Cost of more expensive flour: 20 + 7\n   Cost of more expensive flour: 27\n\n3.

The normal brand of flour costs ₺10/kg, but it was sold out and Diego had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 10% more.\n4.

First, let's find out how much space one plant occupies: \n   The width of each flower is 4 feet.\n   There should be a gap of 16.75 feet between every two flowers (to leave space for growth).\n   So, the space occupied by one plant and its adjacent gaps would be:\n   Space per plant = Width of plant + Gap before it + Gap after it\n                     = 4 ft + 16.75 ft + 16.75 ft \n                     = 37.5 ft\n\n2. Next, let's find out how many plants Yara can fit in her flower bed (which is 201 feet long):\n   Number of Plants = Length of Flower Bed / Space per Plant\n                      ≈ 201 ft / 37.5 ft\n                      ≈ 5.36 \n\nSince you cannot have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to the nearest whole number:\nNumber of Plants Required (including Yara's existing flowers) \n= ⌊ Number of Plants in Flower Bed ⌋ + Existing Flowers \n≈ ⌊ 5.36 ⌋ + 10\n≈ 15\n\n3.

Since each plant takes up a certain amount of space (7 feet) plus some extra space between them (12 feet), we need to determine how many spaces can fit in that length.\n\nLet's assume x number of flowers are planted, so there will be x-1 gaps between the plants because if you have n items and want to know how many 'gaps' there are then it is always going to be one less than n. \n\nSo we need (x - 1) * gap size + plant width = total length.\n\n(x - 1)*12 + 7 = 144\n\nSolving for x:\n(12*x-12)+7=144\n12*x+(-5)=144\n12*x=-139 \nx=(-139)/12 \n\nThis is not a whole number, so we must round down to the nearest integer because you can't have half of a flower. Thus,\nx = 11\n\nSince Kimia already owns 10 flowers and she needs one more plant for each gap between her plants (there will be 11 gaps when x=12), then\nKimia has enough space in her garden bed for:\n1 + 10 = <<11+10=21>>21 flowers.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total cost of buying all necessary flowers.\nSince Kimia already owns 10 flowers, she needs to buy only one more flower. However we know that there will be a gap after each plant and before each is planted so you need (x-1) or in this case (21 - 1). Thus,\nKimia must purchase: \n(21 - 1) = <<20=20>>20 flowers.\n\nThe cost of one flowering plant at the store is ¥5. To find out how much money Kimia will spend, we multiply the number of plants she needs to buy by their price:\n¥ (20 * 5)\n¥100\n\nTherefore, Kimia must spend ¥100 on buying all necessary flowers for her flower bed.\n\n\\boxed{¥100}",

Now we subtract total reserved seats from available space to find out how many tickets are left for guests:\n   Available Tickets = Total Capacity - Reserved Seats\n                      = 3100 - 1750\n                      = 1350\n\n6. Finally, since the question asks about dividing these remaining tickets among graduates (not faculty), and we know there's a total of \n    Graduates' number is equal to reserved seats for them:\n   Number of Graduates = Reserved Seats for Graduates\n                        = 1350\n\n\n7. So now let’s divide available tickets by number of graduating students.\n   Tickets per graduate = Available Tickets / (Number of graduates)\n                         = 1350 / 1350\n\n8. The final result is each student gets to distribute one ticket among their friends and family.\n\nSo, the answer would be:\n\\boxed{1}",

We know she can saute 20 in 16 minutes.\n\nWe will use the following formula:\nTime = (Total Clams / Rate of Sauting)(Sauting Time per batch)\nIn our case: \nRate of Sauting is clams/batch, and each batch has a total time for all clams to be sauted. This means we need 140/20 batches of the same size that Uma can do in (16 minutes)\n\nStep 3: Find how long it will take Uma to peel all her clams.\n- We know from step one she peels at rate(clams/minute)(7), and she needs x number of minutes for 140. This means we divide total number of clams by the peeling speed\nTime = (Total Clams / Rate of Peeling)\n\nNow let's calculate.\n\nFor Step1: \nUma will peel her clams in:\nTime to Peel = Total Number of Clams/Rate of Peeling per minute = 140/7 ≈19.29 minutes\n\nFor step2, Uma needs batches for sauting\nBatches needed for Sauting = (Total number of clams / Rate of Sauteing) \n= 140 clams / 20 clams/batch ≈6.99 or approximately 7 batches \n\nThe time taken by uma to sauté all the peeled clam is: \nTime Taken By Uma To Sauté All Clam = Time for one batch + (Number Of Batches -1)*time between each batch\n=16 minutes*7-15*(0) since there's no waiting time in our case.\n=112\n\nFor step 3, we already found the peeling time as approximately 19.29.\n\nTherefore Uma will take \nTime To Peel And Saute = (Peel Time + Sautéing Time)\n≈(19 minutes+112 minutes)=131 minutes",

First, we need to find out how many carrots Sakura can peel in 5 minutes:\nSince she peels 6 carrots a minute, in 5 minutes, she will be able to peel: \n   6 carrots/minute * 5 minutes = 30 carrots\n\n2. Now that we know Sakura can saute 30 carrots in 5 minutes and it takes her the same amount of time (5 minutes) as peeling for a batch of this size:\nWe need to calculate how many batches she needs to make, by dividing total number of carrots by the number of carrots per batch.\n   Number of carrots = 150\n   Carrots per batch = 30\n\n3. To find out how many batches we have: \n    Batches needed = Total number of carrots / Carrots per batch\n                    = 150 / 30\n                    = 5 batches\n\n4.

But since Sophia has already spent 8 * 15 / 1000 hours= 120 seconds on sauteing the first set of 30 carrots (4 times), she can use that data for this problem.\n\nHowever, it is simpler if we just say \"she peels at a rate of 1 carrot per 15 seconds and will spend x amount of time to peel y number of carrots\" then calculate. We do not know her sautéing speed in terms of time so lets leave it out. \n\nStep 3: Determine how long Sophia takes to peel the total number of carrots.\nShe peels at a rate of 1 carrot every (60/4) minutes = 15 seconds\nTo find out how many times she needs to repeat this, we divide our target by her per-unit time:\n180 / ((60/4))= 12 * 60 \nSo the total amount of time for her peeling task is: 720\n\nStep 4. The final step is simply combining all steps together.\nTo peel and saute 180 carrots it will take Sophia approximately \\boxed{720} seconds, or about (720 / 3600) hours = 1/5 hour",

The first 6 apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so we can calculate their total number of apartments as follows:\n   Total = Number of buildings * Apartments per building\n         = 6 * 200\n         = 1200 apartments\n\n2. Now let's find out how many more apartments the last complex has compared to these six.\n   Since it is '50% bigger' than the other complexes combined, we need to add half as much again of those original numbers in order for this new number to be fifty percent larger:\n   \n   1200 * (1 + .5)\n   = 1800 apartments\n\n3. Mateo collects garbage from all these buildings five times a week and gets paid ₣0.35 per collection.\n   So, we need to multiply the total number of collections he makes in one day with his pay rate:\n   \n   Total daily collections * Payrate\n   = (5 days/week) * 1800 apartments/day * .35₣/apartment/collection\n   \n4.

The formula for Perimeter is P=L+2*H where H stands for Height but in a rectangle, all sides are equal so it will be the same as width.\n\nStep 3: Find the perimeter\nSubstituting values into the equation:\nP=8m+(2 *126 m).\n\nFirst we find product of (2 and Width), which is : \n(2* 126)=252 \n\nNow add length to this value :\n P = 8 + 252\n\nPerforming addition, we get: \nPerimeter(P) = 260.\n\nSo the perimeter of Sanjay's room in meters is \\boxed{260}.",

Round the price of tulips:\n   The current price is €2.25 per bundle.\n   Rounded to the nearest euro (since 0.75 is closer than 0.25), it would be approximately $2, but since we're rounding in terms of dollars and there are no cents involved, we round down to 1 cent below the dollar, which isn't a factor here so we can just use €2 as our rounded price.\n\n   However, given that he has no change today (i.e. he's working with whole numbers for US Dollar), it seems more likely that his prices are being converted from Euro directly into USD without intermediate rounding to euros; in this case, the 0.25 would be below a dollar and we'd round down, giving us $2.\n\n   But as per instructions, let's go ahead with $2.\n   \n2. Round the price of roses:\n   The current price is €5.13 per bundle.\n   Rounded to the nearest euro (since 0.13 is closer than 0.87), it would be approximately $5 but again given his no change policy for US Dollars, we'd round up since that's below a dollar; however in this case we actually have enough dollars so there isn't an issue with rounding down or losing any money.\n\n   So the price of roses is rounded to 6 (i.e. $6).\n\n3. Round the price of sunflowers:\n   The current price is €5.47 per bundle.\n   Rounded up since that's below a dollar, it would be approximately $6.\n\nNow we can calculate Viktor's total earnings:\n\n- Earnings from tulips: 12 bundles * $2 = $24\n- Earnings from roses: 29 bundles * $6 = $174\n- Earnings from sunflowers: 37 bundles * $6 = $222\n\nTotal earnings: $24 + $174 + $222 = $420\n\nSo Viktor will make $\\boxed{420}$.",

Round the price of roses:\n   The original price is ₣2.58 per bundle. To find the rounded price, we can divide 2.58 by 1 (to get dollars) which gives us a non-integer value: \n   So, let's round it to the nearest dollar; since .58 is greater than or equal to .5 then we should round up.\n   \n   Rounded price of roses = ₣3 per bundle\n\n2.

Now let's calculate what he spends on action figures:\n   - Each figure costs €1 and there are 7 of them, so the total cost is: \n     (€1 * 7) = €7\n\n3. Next we need to find out how much money Arash has spent in total now by adding his expenses for candies.\n   - He buys 2 packs of candy bars at a price of each pack being €7:\n     So the cost will be: \n     (€1 * 7) + (€7 x 2)\n     This simplifies to: \n     €7 + (14)\n     Which is equal to: \n     €21\n\n4. Now we need to add Arash's expenses for action figures and candies together:\n   - So the total expense will be: \n     (€1 * 7) + (€7 x 2)\n     This simplifies to: \n     €7 + (14)\n     Which is equal to: \n     €21\n\n5. Finally, we need to subtract Arash's expenses from his initial amount of money:\n   - So the final result will be: \n    Initial Amount = €60\n    Total Expenses  = €21\n    \n    Resulting Money Left After Purchases: (€60) - (€21)\n    \n6. This simplifies to a resulting value, which is equal to: \n   €39\n\nSo Arash has €39 left after his purchases.\n\n\\boxed{€39}",

Calculate Gabrielle's points:\n   Since Gabrielle scored 42 more than half as many of Arash,\n   It means that she got 144 + 42 = 186 \n\n3.

Tara writes the alphabet in full ten times:\n   - The alphabet has 26 letters.\n   - Writing it in full means she is writing all 26 letters each time.\n   - So for these 10 times: 10 * 26 = 260\n\n2. Then, Tara writes 2/4 of the alphabet once (after re-writing everything will be explained below):\n   - The fraction 2/4 can also be written as 1/2 because both numerator and denominator are divided by two.\n   - So she is writing half of the alphabet which equals to: 26 / 2 = 13\n\n3. Now, let's add this information together (but keep in mind that we haven't added anything from step 2 yet since it has happened after everything else):\n   - From the first ten times she wrote full alphabets, Tara had written a total of 260 letters.\n   \n4.

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 2:\n   - So, 2 / 4 = 1 / 2\n3. Therefore, Kai has half as many tubes of indigo paint as Leon.\n4. Since Leon has 18 tubes of indigo paint, we can calculate the number of indigo tubes that Kai has by dividing Leon's total by 2:\n   - Kai's indigo tubes = (1/2) * 18\n5. To find half of 18, we multiply it by 0.5 or divide by 2: \n   - Half of 18 is either 9.\n6. Now let's calculate the number of red paint that Kai has:\n7. Kai has eight times as many tubes of red paint as Leon. We can express this relationship with an equation, where x represents the number of tubes that Leon has and y will represent the total for kai \n   - (8) * 7 = 56\n8. So, Kai has a total of 56 tubes of red paint.\n\nNow we have to add both numbers together: \n\n- Tubes of Indigo + Tubes Of Red Paint = Total number of tubes that Kai possesses.\n9.

Since he mines 5 kgs of ore per day with bare hands:\n- With a nickel pickaxe, the amount is (2 * 5) = 10 kg/day\nWith a diamond pickaxe, it's 30% more than the nickel pickaxe.\nSo we need to find out what 30% of 10kg is: \n(0.3 * 10) = 3 kgs\n\nTherefore, with a diamond pickaxe one goblin mines (10 + 3) kg/day:\n- With a diamond pickaxe, amount mined per day by one goblin is 13kgs.\n\nStep 2: Calculate how much ore all the goblins can mine in total for each of the days.\n20 goblins are mining with their diamond pickaxes. So we need to multiply our result from Step1 (amount mined per day) by number of goblins:\n- Amount of ore mined per day = Number of Goblins * amount mined per goblin \nAmount of ore mined per day = 13kgs/goblin * 20goblins\nAmount of ore mined per day = 260 kgs/day\n\nStep3: Calculate how much all the goblins mine in a month.\nOne month has 28 days. Multiply our result from Step2 (amount mined by one group of goblins) for each of these days:\n- Total amount mined in 1 month = Amount of ore mined per day * number of days \nTotal amount mined in 1 month = 260kgs/day * 28days\nTotal amount mined in a month is therefore: \n\n\\boxed{7280}",

      "raw": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Find out how much ore one miner can mine with a steel pickaxe in a day:**\n\n   First, let's find the amount of ore that can be mined with a nickel pickaxe:\n   \n   One miner mines 5 pounds per day bare-handed.\n   With a nickel pickaxe, he mines two times as much (2 * 5 = 10 pounds).\n   \n   Now we need to calculate how many more pounds one miner can mine in a day using the steel pickaxe. The amount of ore mined with the steel pickaxe is 30% greater than that of the nickel pickaxe.\n   \n   To find this increase, first multiply by 0.3 (which represents 30%), then add it to the number we got from multiplying by two:\n   \n   Increase in pounds = (2 * 5) * 0.3\n                     = 10 * 0.3\n                     = 3\n   \n   So one miner mines 10 + 3 = 13 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.\n\n2. **Calculate how much ore all miners can mine in total:**\n\nNow that we know the individual rate, let's calculate for one month (28 days) to find out how many pounds of ore 26 miners mining together can extract using their steel pickaxes:\n\n   Ore mined per day by 1 miner = 13 pounds\n   Number of miners working together = 26\n   \n   So total ore extracted in a single day:\n   \n   Total ore/day = (13 * 26)\n                  = 338\n\n3. **Find out how much they can mine over the month:**\n\nSince there are 28 days, multiply by this to find the monthly extraction:\n\nTotal Ore/ Month = (338 pounds /day) * 28\n                 = 9484 pounds",

We have 20 liters of lemon drink:\n\nWater in lemon drink = (2/5) x 20\n= 8 liters\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the amount of water in the grape drink**\n\nThe grape drink is one-tenth (1/10) water. We have 30 liters of grape drink:\n\nWater in grape drink = (1/10) x 30\n= 3 liters\n\n**Step 3: Account for the spilled lemon drink**\n\nWe spill 5 liters of the lemon drink, which includes some water and non-water components. To find out how much water is lost, we need to calculate what fraction of the total volume of lemon drink (20 liters) was water:\n\nFraction of lemon drink that's water = 8/20\n= 0.4 or 40%\n\nSo, when we spill 5 liters of lemon drink, we lose:\nWater in spilled lemon drink = 0.4 x 5\n= 2 liters\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total amount of water after pouring**\n\nWe have two sources of water:\n\n1. Water remaining from the original grape drink (30 - 3) + water added to it from the lemon drink:\n   The non-water part is (20-8)=12 and we spilled some, so its 5 liters\nWater in grape drink = 27 \n2. Water left after spilling from the lemon drink: 8 - 2\n\nNow add them together:\n\nTotal amount of water in remaining liquid = 27 + (8 – 2)\n= 33 \n\n**Step 5: Calculate the fraction of total volume that's water**\n\nWe have a total of:\n45 liters (remaining) \nand we calculated above, 33 is our answer to how much is water.\nFraction of total volume that's water = 33 / 45\n≈ 0.7333\n\n**Step 6: Convert the fraction back into a percentage or decimal**\n\nWe can convert this fraction to:\n= (100/137)%\n≈ 73%\n\nThe problem asks for how much water is in the remaining liquid, not what percent it makes up.\n\nSo we should calculate that from above.",

To find out how much water there must have been in the apple mix before pouring, let's subtract what was spilled from it:\n  \n    Water left in Apple Drink = (12 - 2) liters\n                              = 10 liters\n\n5. **Calculate Total Volume of Lemon and Apple Mix**\n\n   The total volume after mixing is given to be 45 liters.\n   \n   We already know the lemon drink has a fixed initial amount, so we can start by subtracting that from our final mix:\n  \n    Water left in apple + (volume of lemon - water content)\n    \n     Total Volume = Volume of Lemon Drink + Spilled Apple Mix\n                  = 30 liters + 15 liters \n                   We now know the volume is indeed 45.\n   \n   From this, we can see that no additional calculation for volume of lemon drink was necessary.\n\n6. **Calculate Water Content in Final Mixture**\n\n    Now let's find out how much water there must be left from our initial volumes after accounting for what has been spilled:\n    \n     Volume of Lemon Drink = 30 liters\n                            We know this already.\n     \n     To calculate the amount of lemon drink that is actually water, we multiply by its fraction (4/5):\n   \n    Water in Lemon Drink = Volume * Fraction \n                          = 30 * 4 / 5 \n                          = 24 liters\n   \n   Then subtract what was spilled from apple to get total water:\n    \n     Total Amount of Water\n                           = Water left in Apple + Water Content of Lemon Mix\n                           = (10) + (24)\n                           = 34 \n\n**The final answer is:**\n\n\\boxed{34}",

So together they make (17 + 12) - 3= 26 liters left to mix and be measured\n\n**Step 2: Find out how many litres are water for each type before any spillage**\n\nFor the lemon drink, we have:\n- Total = 17L\n- Water percentage = 1/7 ≈ 14.29%\nSo, (water in lemon) = 0.1429 * 17 L ≈ 2.42 liters\n\nFor peach drink, we have:\n- Total = 12L\n- Water percentage = 2/4 or 50% \nSo, water in peach is simply:  0.5*12=6 litres \n\n**Step 3: Find out how many liters are left of each after spilling**\n\nWe've already established that we have (23) - (17 – 3)= 9 litres less from the lemon drink and thus only added 14 litres to our mixture.\n\nSo, water in remaining lemon is now approximately :   (0.1429 * (14)) ≈ 2 liters \n\nAnd since no spilling occurred with peach drinks, we still have: 6 L of it\n\n**Step 4: Calculate how much total water there will be after mixing**\n\nSince the two types are mixed together to form a single solution,\n- Total volume = 23 +12=35 litres \nHowever this isn't what is given in our problem. We're only looking at (26) which we know from step one\n\nWe still have:  \n2 liters of water from lemon\n6 L of peach drink \n\nThe total amount of water will be approximately :   (2+ 0.5 *14)= 9 litres",

Calculate the number of weeks in February:\n   Since we are not given any information about leap years or specific dates within February,\n   let's assume that there is no variation and it has a standard month length (28 days).\n\n3. Now, calculate total hours worked by Benjamin during this period.\n   - Hours per week: 36\n   - Weeks in the period: Since we assumed Feb had 28 days which would be approximately equal to \n                         having four weeks; hence number of weeks is 4\n\n    Therefore, Total Hours = 36 * 4 = 144 hours.\n\n3. Calculate Benjamin's weekly earnings:\n   Hourly wage: $11\n   - Earnings per week (before bonus) = total hours/week * hourly rate = 36 * 11 = 396 \n\n4. Now calculate the total amount of money that he earned in February.\n    Total Bonus for a month is calculated as \n     Weekly Bonus * number of weeks worked; so this would be $404 * 4\n   Then add his weekly earnings multiplied by the number of weeks to get his total income:\n      (Weekly Earnings + Bonus) per week * Number of Weeks = ($396 +$404)*4\n\n5.

To find out how many yellow cards there are:\n\n   First, calculate what percentage \"more\" means: \n   \n   If we have a base (orange cards) and add some percent to it, then that added amount will be this base times the percent divided by one hundred.\n   \n   In formula form:\n   \n   Added_amount = Base * Percentage / 100\n   \n   For us, since '45 more' is equivalent of \"adding forty five %\", we can use the following equation for yellow cards calculation (let's call Y - number of yellow cards):\n   \n   Y = Base + (Base * 0.45)\n   \n   The base here is orange card amount which equals to sixty:\n   \n   Y = 60 + (60 * 0.45) \n     \n       = 60 + 27\n       \n       = 87\n   \n   So, the number of yellow cards is eighty seven.\n3. Purple cards are as many as the sum of orange and yellow cards:\n\n   Orange card amount equals sixty:\n   \n   Yellow card amount we already calculated: eighty-seven,\n   \n   Thus purple card amount will be their sum (sixty + eighty-seven) which equals forty-seven.\n\n4. The total number of mentioned color cards is a sum of all three types, that are orange, yellow and purple:\n\n   Orange = 60\n   \n   Yellow = 87\n   \n   Purple = 47\n   \n   Total_cards = Orange + Yellow + Purple\n                = 60 + 87 + 47 \n                  = 194\n\nSo the total number of mentioned color cards is one hundred ninety-four.\n\n\\boxed{194}",

She loses €62/hour in missed income due to doing the taxes herself.\n\nSo, if we calculate how much money she would lose:\n   Lost Income = Number of Hours * Hourly Rate\n               = 11 hours * €62/hour\n               = €682\n\n3. Now let's consider hiring a bookkeeper who charges €98 per hour.\n4. The question asks us to find out \"How much more money will she have if she hires the bookkeeper?\"\n\nThis implies that we are comparing two scenarios: doing taxes herself and paying for a bookkeeper.\n\nSo, subtracting her lost income from what it would cost to hire a bookkeeper:\n   Difference = Cost of Hiring Bookkeeper - Lost Income\n               = €98 * 11 hours (assuming she works the same number of hours as if hiring a bookkeeper)\n                   or simply \n               = €682 \n\nSince we know this is incorrect, let's assume that by doing taxes herself Aisha can earn money from contract work and only loses some income due to not being able to do it. Therefore our assumption was wrong.\n\nLet's correct the calculation:\n\n   Difference = Cost of Hiring Bookkeeper - Lost Income\n               = €98 * 11 hours \n                   or simply (if she does her taxes herself, she can earn money from contract work)  \n               = 0 \n\nThe cost is independent on how many hour Aisha has available for working. Therefore we need to recalculate the difference:\n\n   Difference = Cost of Hiring Bookkeeper - Lost Income\n               = €98 * number_of_hours \n                   or simply (if she does her taxes herself, she can earn money from contract work)  \n               = 0 \n\nWe still have a mistake in our calculation.\n\nLet's correct it by assuming that the problem was asking us to calculate how much more Aisha will lose if doing taxes herself:\n\n   Difference = Lost Income - Cost of Hiring Bookkeeper\n               = €682 - €98 \n               = €584\n\nSo, she would be losing an additional €584 in income if she did her own taxes.\n\nTherefore,\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{€584}$",

If Haruka does her business accounting herself:\n   - She'll lose ₺89/hour in missed income due to not doing part-time work.\n   - Since she can do 8 fewer hours of part-time work, the total amount lost will be: \n     ₺89 * 8 = ₺712\n\n2. If Haruka hires a tax consultant:\n   - The cost of hiring the tax consultant is: \n     ₺69 per hour (but we don't know how many hours she'll have for part-time work)\n\n3. Since we already calculated that not doing her accounting herself will result in lost income, to find out if it's worth hiring a consultant or not, let's assume Haruka would normally do x amount of hours of part-time work.\n   - In this case, the total income she'll get by working those hours is: \n     ₺89x\n   - But since we know that doing accounting herself will result in losing 8 fewer hours worth of income (₺712), and hiring a consultant costs her x amount of time * $69:\n     The equation becomes: \n       ₺89x = x(₺69) + ₺712\n\n4. Let's simplify the above equation to find out what value 'x' should be for Haruka to have more money by hiring a tax consultant.\n   - Simplifying, we get: \n     0=70x-712\n   - Adding both sides of the equation with 712:\n     712 = 70x\n   - Dividing both sides with 70:\n       x ≈10\n\n5.

First, we need to calculate the total weight of everything in Jamal's van.\n\n   The van itself weighs 1900 kilograms.\n   There are groceries weighing 100 kilograms inside.\n   Two young friends weigh a combined 50 + 50 = 100 kilograms each.\n   \n   Total Weight = Van Weight + Groceries Weight + Friends Weight\n                 = 1900 kg + 100 kg + 100 kg\n                 = 2100 kg\n\n2. The problem states that the force to move the van is 4% of its weight.\n\n   Force Required = (Total Weight * Percentage) / 100\n   \n3. Now, we plug in our numbers and calculate:\n\n   Total Weight = 2100 kg (from step 1)\n   \n   To find 4%: Multiply by .04\n   Force Required = (2100 kg *.04)\n\n   Calculating that gives:\n   Force Required ≈ 84 kilograms\n\nSo the answer is \\boxed{84}.",

Since there's one letter going back and forth for every two people involved in the friendship:\n- Each of his friends will send him 6 letters per week (3 * 2).\n- He also responds to each friend with another set of three, so he sends out six as well.\nSo, the number of pages sent or received by Santiago is calculated below:\n\nFor each friend: \nPages sent/received = Number of Friends * Letters Sent/Received Per Week * Pages per Letter\n= 8 friends * 6 letters * 5 pages \n\nStep 3: Calculate how many total pages are being exchanged.\nTotal Page Exchange = (8 * 6) * 5\n                   = 240 pages\n\nStep 4: Determine the time spent writing each week, in minutes and hours.\nSince Santiago writes one page every ten minutes:\nTime Spent Writing Per Week (minutes)\n= Total Pages / Time to Write One Page \n= 240 pages / 10 min/page \n\nNow let's convert this into hours.

Each of these remaining 10 penpals sends him:\n    * 2 letters a week\n    * And each letter is 10 pages long\n\n   Total number of pages received per week from all 10 penpals:\n\n   (2 letters/week) x (10 pages/letter) = 20 pages/penpal-week\n\n   Since there are 10 penpals, he receives:\n   \n   20 pages/penpal-week * 10 penpals = 200 pages a week from all of them.\n\n3. He responds in kind to each letter sent by his remaining 10 pen pals (not the original 14). \n\nSo for every one who writes him two letters per week, he will write back with: \n2 replies/penpal-week * 10 page/reply = 20 pages a reply\n\nHe has 4 people that left so we need to calculate how many letters they sent and then multiply by the total number of letters (replies) from those who are still pen pals.\n\n   Total received in first week:\n    - From original: \n      The four he lost as friends send him two each a week, for ten pages.

We know that Luca is three times older than his father at their second encounter with the comet. This means that by this point in time (when they are both seeing the comet again), x + (75 * number_of_times_seen) years have passed since Luca's first sighting.\n   So, for Luca: 3x = age of Luca when he saw it for the second time\n          => 3x = Luca's current age at his second encounter with the Comet.\n\nFor Luca's father:\n   x + (75 * number_of_times_seen) years have passed since his first sighting. \n   Since he only sees it once, we can say: x is equal to the age of Luca's Father when he saw the comet for the first time\n\n3.

    "logic_problem": {
      "raw": "\n\nTo solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. First, we need to find out how many salmons Umar caught in total.\n   Since he caught 7 salmons last Tuesday (according to the statement), there is no more information about other days.\n\n2. Then, we calculate the weight of all the salmons he caught:\n   The first salmon weighs 45 kgs,\n   the second one weighs 33 kgs, and\n   the last one weighs 36 kgs.\n   \n   Total_weight = First_salmon + Second_salmon + Last_salmon \n                  = 45 kg + 33 kg + 36 kg\n                 (we assume Umar caught only three salmons for simplicity. But we see that he actually caught seven, so let's recalculate)\n   Since there are 7 salmon and we have weight of just three,\n       the remaining four can be calculated by subtracting total known weights from the sum of all known individual weights.\n     Sum_of_known_weights = (45 + 33) kgs\n      Remaining_sum = Total_salmon - Known_salmons \n                       = 7 salmons - 3 salmons\n                      = 4 salmon\n\n   Now we calculate weight of remaining four. Since they are equal, let's call them as 'x'.\n     x * 4 (salmons) + Sum_of_known_weights (in kgs)\n    We know that the total number of salmons is seven and their sum in weights should be \n      Total_weight = x*4+Sum_of_known_weights\n   Now we have to find out value of variable 'x' by using a known formula:\n     45 + 33 +36+x(4) =7*x\n\n    We know that the left side is equal to right. So let's write it in equation form and simplify.\n      x*5=90\n       x=(9/1)\n         (we divided both sides of this equation by five)\n\n   Now we have value of variable 'x', which represents weight of remaining four salmons, 9 kgs each.\n\nNow that we know the weights of all seven salmon, let's add them together:\nTotal_weight = First_salmon + Second_salmon + Last_salmon + Remaining_sum\n             = 45 kg + 33 kg +36kg+4*x \n                 (we have to multiply by four as there are four salmons)\n              Since x=9,\n                Total_weight = 114 kgs\n\n3. Now we know the total weight of all seven salmon is 114 kgs, and each kilogram costs ₣1.5.\n   So let's calculate how much Umar will earn:\nEarnings = Total_weight * Price_per_kg\n        = 114 kg * ₣1.50/kg\n\n4. Multiply the numbers to get your result in Pesetas (₣).\n    Earnings=171 ₣",

Faisal has to take 2 extra classes each day for 4 days a week.\n   - Each class is 30 minutes long, so the total time spent in these classes per day = 2 * 30 = 60 minutes\n   - Since he does this for 4 days a week, total weekly learning hours from these classes = (60/60) * 4 = 4 hours\n\n2. He spends one-eighth of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.\n   - First we need to find out how many minutes are in a normal week for Faisal: A day has 24*60=1440 minutes\n     There are 6 periods (or classes) which is 30*6 =180. This makes the total number of class/periods per day equal to 6 * 4 =240, or 180 + 2 extra class period of time for a week as 6(7-1)=42\n     So his normal weekly learning in minutes would be (1440) x 6=8640. With the two classes being added we now have 8 periods/Classes which is equal to (30)(8)=240 min per day or 1680 total min of class time for a week.\n   - Faisal spends one-eighth of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time\n     = Total weekly minutes / 8 \n     = 1680 / 8\n     = 210 minutes\n\n3. Now, we need to convert the total hours spent in classes (4 hours) from step 1 and the additional hours spent on Saturday and Sunday (210/60=3.5 hours)\n   - Total learning time per week = Class time + Extra time \n                                = 4 + 3.5\n                                = 7.5\n\nSo, Faisal spends **\\boxed{7.5}** hours a week learning.\n\nNote: This answer is in decimal form since the question doesn't specify which rounding method to use for non-integer values of total weekly time spent on classes/learning",

We need the total number of classes, which includes his regular schedule.\n   \n   First, let's calculate how many extra minutes Arash has in a normal week:\n   \n   A student with a normal schedule would have: \n   (8 hours * 60) = 480 minutes\n   Since he only needs to attend school for 6 days of the week. We will multiply by 5.\n   So, we get 2400 minutes\n\n   Arash takes an extra three classes:\n   \n   - Each class is 45 minutes long: \n     (3 * 45) = 135 minutes\n   Now let's calculate his new total weekly attendance in a normal week:\n   2400 + 135 = 2535 minutes\n   \n2. **Determine the number of hours he spends learning per day in school:**\n\n   - We already know that Arash goes to class for 6 days.\n   - Since we're calculating this time over his entire schedule, let's first convert all weekly attendance from a normal student into an average daily value:\n     (2400 minutes / 5) = 480 minutes per day\n   Then add the extra classes he has in each of those school days. We'll assume it is one class for simplicity.\n   \n   - One 45-minute class: \n       (1 * 45) = 45 minutes\n   \n   Now, we can find Arash's daily attendance:\n     480 + 45 = 525 minutes\n\n3. **Calculate the number of hours he spends learning per day in school:** \n\n    We already know that his total weekly time is spent for 6 days.\n    - Convert all this to an average value: \n      (2535 / 6) = approximately 422.50 minutes\n   Now convert these minutes into a more understandable format:\n\n     Since we want hours, let's divide by sixty:\n       (422.50 / 60) ≈ 7.042\n\n4. **Calculate the amount of time Arash spends on Saturday and Sunday:**\n\n    - He has one-sixth of his weekly total available for learning.\n   \n   We already know that he uses all this extra time to learn, so let's find out how many minutes it is:\n     (2535 / 6) = approximately 422.50\n\n   Convert the value into hours by dividing with sixty:\n\n    - ((422.50 / 60)) ≈ 7.042 \n\n5. **Calculate Arash' total weekly time spent learning:**\n\n    We've already calculated his regular school attendance in a week (2535 minutes).\n     Then, we have to add all of the extra Saturday and Sunday hours.\n \n   Now let's find out how many more hours he spends on these days:\n      ((422.50 * 2) / 60)\n   \n   This equals: approximately 14.084\n\n6. **Calculate Arash' total weekly time spent learning in a final format:** \n\n    We already know that his regular school attendance is (2535 minutes).\n     Then, we have to add all of the extra Saturday and Sunday hours.\n \n   Now let's find out how many more hours he spends on these days:\n      ((422.50 * 2) / 60)\n   \n   This equals: approximately 14.084\n\nNow let's calculate his final weekly time in minutes by adding both values:\n\n(2535 + (422.50*2)) = 3379.50 \n\nFinally, convert the value into hours:\n \n    ((3379.50/60))\n\nThis is equal to: approximately **56.316**",

      "raw": "\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Jamal has to take 2 extra classes, each class is 35 minutes long.\n   So, he spends an additional (2 x 35) = 70 minutes per day in class.\n\n2. He goes to class for 6 days a week:\n   Total time spent on weekdays: 7 * 60 * 6 + 70 * 6\n   The above equation is the total of regular periods and extra classes, we need to convert them into just minutes.\n   \n3. Convert the weekday hours into just minutes (already done in step2) = (420+420)+420=1260 minutes\n\n4. We also know he spends five-sixths of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time:\n   Since there are 24 hours, we can calculate that there are a total of 7 * 60 + 35 = 455 minutes in an hour.\n   \n5. Calculate the number of regular periods: \n   (7*6)*60=2520\n   Total weekly minutes for regular classes: 1260+70*2=1400\n\n6. The remaining time is spent on weekend extra learning:\n   Weekly total minutes = ((420/35)+2)*455 = 6305.\n   \n7. Since he spends five-sixths of his weekly minutes each as extra learning, we can calculate the number of hours (or just minutes) by multiplying this fraction with the remainder: \n   Five sixths is equal to 3500 minutes\n\n8. Now add both weekend and weekday time:\n   Total hours per week spent in class = ((1260 +70*2)+5/6 *6305)/60\n   \n9.

So we multiply his daily time by this value (considering Saturday and Sunday as non-school days):\n440 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 2640 minutes per week.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total number of extra learning hours Thiago spends on Saturdays.\nHe spends three-sixths of his weekly minutes each on Saturday. First, we find out how many minutes he has in a week:\n2640 / (40) = 66 days worth of classes\nNow let's calculate what fraction of that is one sixth: \n1/6 * 66 ≈10.9.\nSo for Saturdays and Sundays combined you have two times this number:\n2* 10.9 ≈21.8\n\nStep 4: Calculate the total extra learning hours Thiago spends on Sundays (similar to step 3).\nThe result from Step 3 is already the value we need.\n\nStep 5: Add up all of his minutes spent in class and add it with Saturday's and Sunday time.\nWe first convert our Saturdays/Sundays numbers into minutes:\n21.8 days * (40/60) = hours ≈14\nAdding that to Thiago's weekly schooltime gives us the final answer.\n\n2640 + 2*14 \n= 2664\n\nTherefore, he spends approximately \\boxed{44} hours a week learning in class and on extra time spent on Saturdays/Sundays.",

Calculate the total number of minutes Faisal spends in class each day:\n   - There are 3 extra classes and a normal student has 6 periods.\n   - So, Faisal has to take (6 + 3) = 9 periods per day.\n   - Each period is 35 minutes long, so he spends 9 x 35 = 315 minutes in class each day.\n\n2. Calculate the total number of minutes Faisal spends in class on a weekday:\n   - He goes to class for 4 days a week.\n   - So, he spends (315 * 4) = 1260 minutes per week in class.\n\n3. Convert these weekly minutes into hours:\n   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.\n   - Therefore, Faisal spends 1260 / 60 = 21 hours in class each week.\n\n4. Calculate the number of extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:\n   - He spends four-sixths (or 2/3) of his weekly minutes as extra learning time.\n   - His total weekly minutes are 7 days * 315 minutes per day, which is 2205 minutes.\n   - So he spends 4/6 or two-thirds of this on Saturday and Sunday. That's (4 / 6) x 2205 = 1470 minutes.\n\n5. Convert these extra learning time into hours:\n   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so Faisal spends 1470 / 60 = 24.5 hours as extra learning time each week on Saturday and Sunday.\n\n6. Add the total number of hours spent in class (21) to the extra learning time per week (24.5):\n   - The result is: 45.5\n\nTherefore, Faisal spends \\boxed{45.5} hours a week learning.",

After spending this much on snacks, he still has 9% of his original money left.\n\nSo, the amount of money he spent can be represented as:\nx - (0.09)x = 90,000\n\nNow let's solve for x:\n\n(1-0.09)x = 90000\n(0.91)x = 90000\n\nDividing both sides by 0.91 to isolate x gives us the initial amount of money Arash had:\nx ≈ (90000 / 0.91)\nx ≈ 98,901 cents\n\n2. Now that we know how much he started with and spent on popcorn:\n\n- Each bag of popcorn costs 30 cents.\n- He bought 5 bags.\n\nThe total cost for the popcorn can be represented by multiplying the number of bags (5) by the price per bag:\nTotal_popcorn_cost = 5 * 30\n= 150\n\n3. Subtract this amount from his initial money to find how much he had left after buying popcorn:\n\nMoney_left_after_popcorn = x - Total_popcorn_cost \n≈ 98,901 cents - 150 cents\n≈ 98,751 cents \n\n4. Now let's calculate the remaining percentage of Arash's original money that can be spent on pretzels.\n\nSince he had 9% left after buying popcorn and pretzels:\nMoney_left_after_pretzels = (0.09)x \n= (0.09) * 98,901 cents\n≈ 8,881 cents \n\n5. Now we know how much money Arash has spent on both the popcorns and pretzels combined.\nHe had 98,751 cents left after buying popcorn.\n\nThe difference between this amount and what he would have if all his remaining money was used to buy pretzels is:\nMoney_spent_on_pretzels = Money_left_after_popcorn - Money_left_after_pretzels\n≈ (98351) cents\n\n6. We also know that each bag of popcorn costs 30 cents, and Arash bought five bags.\n\nNow we need to find out how many pretzels he can buy with the money spent on them:\nMoney_spent_on_pretzels = Number_of_pretzels * Price_per_pretzel\n\n7. We already know that each bag of popcorn costs 30 cents, so now let's divide Money_spent_on_pretzels by price per pretzel to find out how many bags he bought.\n\nPrice_per_pretzel = (0.50) dollars \n\nNow we can calculate Number_of_pretzels:\nNumber_of_pretzels = Money_spent_on_pretzels / Price_per_pretzel\n≈ 98351 cents / (50000 * 10^-2)\n= 1967",

      "raw": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.\n\n**Step 1: Convert the amount of money Faisal spent from euros to cents**\nSince there are 100 cents in a euro, and he spent €1400:\n€1400 * 100 = 140000 cents (amount spent)\n\nHowever, since he had some change left over, this is not all that was actually paid.\n2% of his original money remained as change. This means the amount Faisal actually spent must be more than what we have here.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate how much money he started with**\nLet's say x cents = total starting cash\nx - (amount spent) + (change remaining) = x\n\nSince the 'change' is a portion of his original, it will equal to:\n0.02 * x (or simply 2% in decimal form).\n\nThe equation now looks like this:\n\nx - amount_spent = change \nOr,\nx - (140000) = (amount spent)*(1- .02)\nThus giving us\nx = 143400.\n\nSo the original money is equal to:\nx=143400\n\n**Step 3: Calculate how much Faisal actually paid**\nFaisal's total payment would be his starting amount minus what he has left over.\nPayment made by him equals to \npayment_made=x-(change remaining)\nThe equation now looks like this:\n\namount_spent = x - (0.02 * x) \n\nSubstituting the value of 'x' from above, we get\n143400 -( 2%* 143400)=140000\n\nThis shows that he actually spent €1,400.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate how much money was paid for crackers**\nFaisal bought 6 bags of crackers at a cost of $0.25 each:\ncracker_cost = number_of_crackers * price_per_cracker\n= (6) * ($0.25)\n$1.50\n\nThis is the total amount he spent on crackers.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate how much money was left for popcorn**\nTo find out how many bags of popcorn Faisal bought, we need to subtract his expenses from what he paid:\npopcorn_cost = payment_made - cracker_cost\n= $140000 - $1.50\n\nThe calculation seems incorrect since the number is in cents and not dollars.\nCorrecting it,\n$1400-(6*25)= 1395 \n\nNow, \npopcorn_cost=$1395-$1.50\n\nPopcorn cost equals to:\n1389.50\nThis was spent by him on popcorn.\n\n**Step 6: Determine how many bags of popcorn Faisal bought**\nEach bag costs $0.50.\nTo find the number of bags he purchased,\nnumber_of_popcorn_bags = total_expenses / price_per_bag_of_popcorn\n\nPopcorn cost equals to:\n1389 \n\nNow, \npopcorn_cost=$1395-$1.50\nWhich gives us popcorn cost equal to 1389.\n\nNumber of popcorn bag bought by him is given as:-\n1389/0.5",

      "raw": "\n\nTo solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. Initially:\n   - Number of artists = 46\n   - Number of lawyers = 74\n   - Total number of people at the beginning = 46 + 74 = 120\n\n2. After two hours (two-thirds of total people left):\n   - Two-thirds of 120 is (2/3) * 120 = 80.\n   - So, the remaining one-third of 120 = 120 / 3 = 40.\n\nSince there are a total of 46 artists initially and we know that some stayed after two hours, let's calculate how many left:\n\n- Number of artists who remained at the conference = 21\n\nTherefore:\n- The number of artists who left is: 46 - 21 = 25\nAnd since in step 1 it was mentioned a total of one-third people are remaining so \nthe number of lawyers that stayed after two hours will be (40) - (25), as we already know the number of artists staying, and here the question asks for how many lawyers left. So:\n\n- Number of lawyers who remained at the conference = 40 - 25\n= 15\n\nSo there are \\boxed{15} lawyers remaining after two hours at the conference",

      "answer": 13.0

    "logic_problem": {
      "raw": "\n\nTo solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Initially:\n   - Number of teachers = 34\n   - Number of doctors = 62\n\n2. Total number of people initially: \n   - total_people_initially = 34 (teachers) + 62 (doctors)\n   - total_people_initially = 96\n\n3. After two hours, two-thirds of the total number of people left:\n   - Two-thirds of total_people_initially is equal to (2/3)*total_people_initially\n   - This will be the fraction that leaves.\n   \n4. Fraction of people who stayed: \n   - The remaining one-third would stay which equals 1-(2/3) = 1/3\n\n5. Total number of people after two hours:\n   - Since (2/3)*total_people_initially left, then total_people_after_two_hours will be equal to\n     1/3 * initial_total_number_of_people \n    - This is the fraction that stays.\n   \n6. We know from step 4 and 5 that we have a number of people staying after two hours which equals (1/3) times the original amount of total people:\n   - Let's call this remaining fraction 'x'.\n   - Then x = (1/3)*total_people_initially \n     x = ((1/3)*(34+62))\n      This is what we need to find.\n   \n7. Total number of teachers who stayed at the celebration: 19.\n\n8. Since there are two groups, doctors and teachers, let's first calculate total people that left:\n   - People_left = (2/3)*total_people_initially\n     We know from step 1 what initial_total_number_of_people is.\n   \n9. Then we can find out how many of those who stayed at the celebration were doctors by using this information and solving for 'x' in equation x + y = total number after two hours:\n   - Here, let's denote people_left as (2/3)*total_people_initially\n     We know from step 1 what initial_total_number_of_people is.\n   \n10. Since we have the amount of teachers staying at celebration and that there are doctors also present in this group then total number after two hours must be equal to \n    - People who stayed = (19 + x), where 'x' represents remaining people which could either be a doctor or teacher.\n\n11. Then, if 19 is number of the teacher's left, it means we can find out how many doctors are there by subtracting this from total after two hours:\n   - Number_of_doctors_left = (1/3)*total_people_initially - remaining_number_of_teachers\n\n12. Now let's calculate 'x' and then put numbers into the equation.\n    From step 6, we know x equals ((1/3)*(34+62))\n     So now that we have our number for people staying at celebration after two hours:\n   - total_people_after_two_hours = (19 + x)\n   \n13. The problem states there were initially a certain amount of doctors and teachers so let's plug those numbers in to get the answer.\n    From step 1, initial_total_number_of_teachers is equal to 34\n     We also know from that same statement total_initial_doctors = 62\n\n14. Therefore we have x equals (total number after two hours minus remaining number of teachers)\n   - Number_of_doctors_left = ((19 + x) )- 19 \n      This will give us the amount left.\n\n15. Since there are doctors and also people other than doctors at celebration, let's plug in our numbers from steps 1 to find out how many doctors remain.\n    We know total number after two hours equals (1/3)*total_people_initially\n     From step 4 we found remaining fraction is one-third of the original amount.\n\n16. Then since there are teachers left at celebration, let's plug in our numbers from steps 9 to find out how many doctors remain.\n    We know total number after two hours equals (1/3)*total_people_initially\n     From step 4 we found remaining fraction is one-third of the original amount.\n\n17. Therefore if there were initially a certain amount of people at celebration, then let's plug those numbers in to find out how many doctors remain.\n    We know total number after two hours equals (1/3)*total_people_initially\n     From step 4 we found remaining fraction is one-third of the original amount.\n\n18. Now that we have our equation for finding x and also given information about teachers who stayed at celebration, let's plug those numbers in to find out how many doctors remain.\n    We know total number after two hours equals (1/3)*total_people_initially\n     From step 4 we found remaining fraction is one-third of the original amount.\n\n19.

Determine how many nurses were among those who left.\n3. Find out how many nurses are still at the meeting.\n\nStep 1: \nFirst, let's calculate the total number of engineers and nurses initially:\n- Engineers = 41\n- Nurses = 74\n\nTotal initial people = Engineers + Nurses = 115\n\nTwo-fifths (2/5) of these people left after two hours. To find out how many people that is:\n\n(2 / 5) * Total_initial_people = (2 / 5) * 115 ≈ 46 \n\nSo, approximately 46 people left.\n\nStep 2: \nWe know there were initially 41 engineers and a total of 74 nurses.\nIf we subtract the number of engineers who stayed from the initial number of engineers to find out how many engineers left:\n- Engineers_left = Initial_engineers - Engineers_stayed\n= 41 - 30 (given)\n= 11\n\nSince two-fifths of all people left, and there were approximately 46 people in total that is equal to those who stayed plus the ones who left. We can use this information for next steps.\n\nStep 3: \nNow let's find out how many nurses are still at the meeting:\nWe know from step 1 (approximation) that around 46 people have left, which includes both engineers and nurses.\nIf we subtract these numbers of those who stayed plus leave from total initial number to get a clearer picture. We already calculated in Step one there were approximately 115 initially.\n\n- Total_who_stayed = Engineers + Nurses\nWe also know:\nTotal_people_left ≈ People_initial - People_stay\n\n46 (approximate) people left, which is equal to the ones who stayed plus leave from total initial number.\nNow let's calculate how many nurses are still at the meeting:\n\nPeople_initial = 115 \nApproximately 30 engineers stay.

We will use the same logic for Nurses.\n\nLet's find out how many nurses are still at the meeting:\n- 11 engineer have leave from the initial 41 which is two-fifth of all people left (approximate) who were engineers and nurse together.\nWe can write an equation like this:\n\n(2 / 5)(n + 41) ≈ People_left \nwhere n represents number of Nurses.\n\nSubstitute value for People_left in above expression, we have\n(2/5)(n+41) = 85\n\nFirst multiply both sides by (5/2).\nThis gives us:\nn + 41 = ((5 / 2)*85)\nSimplify the equation and solve it to find n.\n(n+41)=212.50 \nSubtracting 41 from each side, we get\nn=171.5 \n\nSince number of nurses should be an integer (whole numbers), above value is not possible as per given data.\n\nTo correct this let's recalculate people_left using engineers who stayed and initial number.\nPeople_stay + People_leave = Total_initial_people\n\nLet's put values in equation:\n30+people leave=115\nSolving for people leave we get: 85 \n\nSince two-fifths (2/5) of all people left, which is equal to the ones who stayed plus leave from total initial number.\nWe already calculated that around 46 people have left in step one.\n\nLet's find out how many nurses are still at the meeting:\n- People_left = Total_people - People_stay\n= 115 - 30 \nPeople_leave ≈ 85 \n\nSince two-fifths (2/5) of all people left, we can also calculate this using engineers who stayed and initial number as well.\nWe know that Engineers_left + Engineers_stayed equals to total Engineers.

Now let's solve for x:\n\n   First multiply both sides by x to get rid of fractions:\n   \n   52 * (5) / 21 = 20\n   \n   This simplifies down into: \n   \n   26/1 = 20/(x)\n   \n   So we have, the equation that is equal on each side so then cross-multiply and you will find out what x equals.\n   \n   Cross Multiply:\n   \n   (52 *5) = (20*x)\n   \n   Simplify down into: \n   \n   260=20*(x)\n   \n   Divide both sides by twenty to get the value of X.\n   \n   The result is that there were a total number of doctors and lawyers who stayed behind equal to x equals thirteen point five.",

Ananya buys 8 shares of a stock for ¥75 each.\n   - Total cost = Number of shares × Price per share\n   - Total cost = 8 × ¥75\n   - Total cost = ¥600\n\n2. The stock price increases by 60% in the first year:\n   - Increase in price = Current price × (Increase percentage / 100)\n   - New price after increase = Old price + (Old price * Increase percentage / 100)\n   - Since we don't know the old price, let's call it x. We can say that ¥75 is equal to 1x.\n   - Price before first year increase: 1x\n   - First-year increase: 60% of 1x = (0.6) * (1x)\n   - New stock value after the first year increase: 1x + ((0.6) * (1x)) \n   - Simplify the above expression to get new price in terms of x:\n     - New price = 1x + 0.6(1x)\n     - New price = 1x + 0.6x\n     - New price after increase: 1.6 * (Price per share)\n\n3. Now, we can calculate the value of Ananya's shares in the first year:\n   - Value after increase = Number of shares × Price per share after increase\n   - Since new stock value is equal to ¥75 + 0.6¥75=¥78 for one share,\n     then New price is: (1x) * (1+0.60)= (1x)*(1.6)\n   - Value = 8 shares × ¥(7.5 * 1.6)\n   - Value after first year increase = 8 × ¥12\n   - Value after the first year increase = ¥96\n\n4. The stock price decreases by 15% in the second year:\n   - Decrease in value = Current value × (Decrease percentage / 100)\n   - New value after decrease = Old value − (Old value * Decrease percentage / 100)\n\n5. Calculate Ananya's final share values, considering a new current stock price is ¥81 per share.\n   Value before the second year: ¥96\n   Second-year decrease: 15% of ¥(7.8)= ¥1.17 \n   New stock value after the second year = ¥80\n\n6. Now we can calculate Ananya's final shares:\n   - Final value = Number of shares × Price per share in the second year\n   - Since new price is equal to (Price per share) * 0.85,\n     then new current stock price: ¥(7.5)*(1-0.15)= ¥6.375 \n   - Value after decrease = 8 × ¥80\n   - Final value of Ananya's shares = ¥640\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{¥640}",

Chen can run four times faster than she can walk.\n\nThis means if her walking speed is x miles per hour, then her running speed will be 4x miles per hour.\n\n2. But she can skip at a rate of speed that is two-fifths as fast as she can run.\n\nIf we let r = the speed of skipping in mph and s = the speed of running in mph, \nthen we have: r = (2/5) * s\n\n3. If Chen spends 6 hours walking, then since she walks for only a fraction of that time,\nthe actual number of hours spent on other activities must be less than or equal to 6.\n\nThe total amount of time is given as 6 hours and we know this will include two-sixths of the time running (2/6 * 6 = 2) \nand also includes some walking. Since she spends only a fraction of that time, then: \n\n0 < (1 - 2/6 - 2/3)\n\nSimplifying gives us:\n(1-4/6)-2/3<0\n(-5+6)/18=-1/18\n\nWhich means the actual amount spent on other activities is greater than 1 – 7 / 18 = 11 / 18 \n\nSince she spends two-sixths of that time running, which we know to be less than or equal to six hours,\nwe can write this as: \n2 < (6 * 5/9)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n(10)/3<6\n\nWe now have the information needed for Chen's speeds.\n\n4. Since she spends two-sixths of her time running, we know that r = (s) x (2 / 6)\n= s x (1 / 3).\nAlso since we are told r = s/5,\nwe can write this as: \n(1/3)s=s/5\n\nSolving for s gives us:\ns=(5/3)\n\nNow let's convert the time spent on walking into a fraction of her total speed.\nThe amount of time she spends walking is 2 / 3 * 6 = 4 hours\nand so we have: \n(1 - (2/6) – (2/3))=11/18 \n\nWe can find Chen's skipping rate as follows:\nr=(s)x((2/5))\nNow substituting s with the previously determined value of (5 / 3),\nwe get r = ((5 / 3)*x(2 / 5)\nWhich simplifies to: \nr = (4 / 15) mph\n\nWe now have Chen's speed for walking, running and skipping.\n\nGiven that we are told she can skip at a rate of speed that is two-fifths as fast as she can run,\nwe know r= s/2.5\nWhich gives us the value: \ns=(4 * 15)/4 = (60 / 4) mph\n\nWe now have Chen's speeds.\n\nNow let’s use this information to solve for how many miles she travels in a given amount of time.\nIf we are told that r= s/2.5 and also know that s= (10/3),\nthen we can write: \ns = ((60 / 4) * x(1 / 6))\nWhich simplifies to:\nr=(30*15)/20 mph\n\nWe now have Chen's speed for running.\n\nThe amount of time she spends walking is given as 2/3 times the total number of hours, which we know to be six.\nThis means that if t=total number of hours,\nthen: \nt * (1 - ((4) /6)) = 6\nWhich simplifies to:\n(5)*t*=(10)\nSo now we can write this as: \ns*(2/3)t=s*(20)/15\n\nWe know Chen’s walking speed and the amount she walks in a given time.\nIf her total number of hours is six, then (1 – 4 /6) * t = 4\nWhich simplifies to:\n(5)*t=10 \n\nSince we now have all that information,\nwe can calculate how many miles she travels.\n\nThe distance traveled while walking would be the product of Chen's speed and time spent on this activity.\nGiven her total amount of hours is six, \nthe number of hours walked in a given period will then equal: 2/3 * (6) = 4\nSo now we can write:\ndistance_walked = s x t_walking\n\nWe know the distance traveled while walking and running.\n\nNow let’s use this information to solve for how many miles she travels.\nThe total amount of time is six hours, which includes two-sixths of that being spent on other activities,\nand also some walking.

Daphne can skip at 2 miles per hour.\n\nSince she skips at a rate of speed that is 1/5 as fast as she can run:\n   Let x be her running speed\n   Then (1/5)x = 2 mph\n\nSolving for x gives us the following equation:\n\nx = 10 mph (her running speed)\n\n2. Daphne runs two times faster than she walks, so let's call walking speed y.\n   Therefore: \n   Running Speed = 2y\n   Since we know her running speed is 10mph:\n   \n   2y = 10\n\nSolving for y gives us the following equation:\n\ny = 5 mph (her walking speed)\n\n3. Daphne spends two-fourths of the time running and two-fourths of the time walking.\n   The total amount of time spent on both activities is: \n   Two-fourth * Total Time + Two-fourth * Total Time\n   Since it's a fraction, we can simplify this to 1/2 * Total Time + 1/2 * Total Time = Total Time\n\nHowever in our case the problem asks for \"two fourths\" which means two fourths of total time is spent on each activity. So let us calculate: \nTwo-fourth of eight hours:\n   (2 /4) x 8\n   This simplifies to: 1/2 * 8 = 4\n\nTherefore, Daphne spends a total of 4 hours running and another 4 hours walking.\n\nNow that we know the time each activity is performed for, let's calculate how far she can travel in those activities:\n\n- She runs at 10 mph for 4 hours:\n   Distance Run = Speed * Time\n               = (10) * (4)\n               = 40 miles\n\n- She walks at 5 mph for 4 hours:\n   Distance Walked = Speed * Time \n                    = (5) * (4)\n                    = 20 miles \n\nTherefore, the total distance she can travel is:\n\nTotal Distance = Distance Run + Distance Walked\n                = 40 miles + 20 miles\n                = 60 miles\n\nSo the final answer to this problem would be:\n\\boxed{60}",

We are given that she can skip at 3 miles per hour.\n\nWe know that her skipping rate is 1/4 of her run rate (since she skips 1/4 as fast). Therefore:\n\nSkip Rate = Run Rate / 4\n3 mph = Run Rate / 4\n\nTo find the run rate, we multiply both sides by 4:\nRun Rate = 12 mph\n\nNow that we have Ananya's running speed, let's consider her walking and skipping speeds. We are given that she can walk at a certain unknown speed.\n\nSince she runs two times faster than walks (Ananya can run two times faster), the following equation is true:\n\nWalk Speed * 2 = Run Rate\nWalk Speed * 2 = 12 mph\n\nTo find Ananya's walking speed, we divide both sides by 2:\nWalk Speed = 6 mph\n\nNow that we have all of her speeds (walking at 6 mph and running at 12 mph), let's consider how she spends the time.\n\nShe spends three-sixths of the time (5 hours out of a total of 10) running, so in those five hours she runs for:\nDistance = Speed * Time\n= 12 miles/hour * 5 hour \n= 60 miles\n\nAnanya also walks half of the time.

The problem states the following: \"She can skip at a rate of speed that is 1/4 as fast as she can run, and if she skips for some amount of hours then walks for half of her remaining time.\" Since walking takes up five out of ten total hours (or fifty percent), we know Ananya spends five hours walking. She has spent three-sixths running which equals to: \n3 / 6 *10 =5\nThe only other option is that she must have skipped the rest, so:\n(1 - .67) * 10 =3 out of ten.\nThus in this case for three hours Ananya skips at a rate of speed. Therefore during those 3 hours (Ananya has spent her time walking and running), we can calculate how far she travels by using:\nDistance = Speed * Time\n= 1/4 * Run Rate \n(1 / 4) *12 miles/hour* 3 hour \n=9\n\nAdding up all of Ananya's distances, the total is as follows: \n\n60 +30+ 9 =99",

If she can skip at 4 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 8 hours if she spends two-fourths of the time running and one-half of the time walking?",

    "logic_problem": {
      "raw": "\n\nTo solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Tara can skip at 4 miles per hour.\n\n2. She can run two times faster than she can walk and her skipping speed is 2/5 of her running speed.\n   Let x be the walking speed in miles/hour\n   Then, Running Speed = 2x (two times faster)\n   Since Skipping Speed = 2/5 * Running Speed,\n   then we have: \n   4 = 2 / 5 * 2x\n\n3. Solve for x:\n   Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction\n   Then, you get: \n   20 = (2*2)x \n   Simplify this equation to find that \n   20 = 4x \n\n   Divide by 4 on both side of the equation.\n   You then have,\n   x= 20/4 which is equal to 5\n   Therefore, Tara can walk at a speed of 5 miles per hour.\n\n4. Now we know Tara's walking and running speeds (2 * her walking speed = 10 mph) \n   We are given that she spends two-fourths of the time running.\n   That means one-half of the time is spent on other activities, which includes skipping\n   Since there is only three fourths left for running or skipping,\n   Tara runs at a rate of (2/4)*3 = 1.5 times her walking speed in this given scenario.\n\n5. So we have two speeds: \n    - Walking Speed = x= 5 mph.\n    - Running Speed = 10 mph\n\n6. Since she can skip at a rate that is 2 / 5 of the running speed, Tara skips at (1/4)*3 * her walking speed\n   Therefore, Skipping Speed = (1/4) * 3 * x \n   But we know that x= 5,\n    So Skipping Speed = (1/4) * 15 which is equal to 3.75 mph.\n\n7. We are given the time she spends on each activity: two-fourths of the time running and one-half walking.\n8. Let's find how much time Tara has in total:\n   Since we know that there are three fourths for skipping or running, then \n    Total Time = 3/4 * t where 't' is eight hours.\n\n9. We can now calculate this using simple algebra\n   First multiply both sides by four to eliminate the fraction,\n     Then you get: \n      (12)t=8\n\n10 Divide by twelve on both side of the equation.\n    You then have, \n       8/12 = t which equals one half or .5 hours.\n\n11 So Tara has a total time of eight /3 *4 = five and two thirds hour to skip or run. \n\nHowever, in this case it is equal to three fourths times eight since there are only four quarters.\n    We can now calculate the distance she covers during her activities using simple algebra\n   Distance covered while running equals speed multiplied by time,\n     So Tara's Running Distance = 10 * (2/4) *8 which is 16 miles.\n\n12 The same formula applies to skipping, \n     Skipping Distance= Speed*Time.\n     In this case the distance she covers in eight hours at a rate of four mile per hour equals\n      Skipping Distance = speed multiplied by time,\n       So Tara's Skipping Distance = 4 * (1/2)*8 which is equal to sixteen miles.\n\n13 Now, we can add both distances together and then find out how many total miles Tara traveled \n    Total Miles Covered= Running Dist + Skipped Distance.\n   Therefore: \n     Total Miles covered in eight hours at a rate of four mile per hour equals\n      16+16 =32\n\nTherefore,\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{32}.",

Since there are three times as many apples as kiwis, we can find the initial number of apples:\nInitial apples = 3 * Initial kiwis\n= 3 * 33\n= 99\n\nStep 2: Calculate the new number of kiwis after buying more.\nAndre bought 66 more kiwis at the store. So, the total number of kiwis now is:\nNew kiwis = Initial kiwis + Additional kiwis\n= 33 + 66\n= 99\n\nHowever, since Andre's initial kiwi count was already provided as 33 and he purchased a further amount (which we calculated to be also equal to his original), this means the given information about purchasing more is inconsistent. But let's continue with what we know so that we can find out if there are any inconsistencies or errors in our reasoning.\n\nStep 3: Determine the new number of apples after buying fewer.\nAndre bought 48 fewer apples than kiwis, but since he purchased additional kiwi (66), and his original amount was already given as 33. If this is indeed what happened then it would be 99+6=105 for the first purchase in total (since we are not using any of that information because we calculated to get a count of apples equaling our initial number which seems like an inconsistency). However, since he bought fewer than kiwis and there were initially three times as many apples as kiwis. The amount purchased should have been 48 less than the new total of kiwis (99).\n\nNew apples = Initial apples - Additional decrease\n= 3 * New kiwis - 48 \nSince we know that his original number was 33, this means our initial equation will be: \n   a + b = c   \nWhere:\n- 'a' is three times the amount of Kiwi.\n- 'b' represents how much apples he purchased (which would have been less than kiwis).\n- and 'c' equals to his total number of items after purchase.\n\nWe already know that we must calculate this using 99, which was our new count for both. Since there is an inconsistency in the problem with regards to information about purchasing additional fruit: let's find out what would happen if he purchased fewer apples than kiwis (and had three times as many initially), and then use a different method of solving.\n\nLet 'x' be how much less apples were bought compared to new total amount. Then we can set up the following equation:\n   3(99) - x = c\n\nNow that this has been calculated, let's find out what would happen if he purchased fewer than kiwis: \n\nSince his original number was three times as many and he had a count of 33 for the initial amount. To get how much apples are left after buying less we will use:\n   (3 * Initial Kiwi) - x = c\n\nWe can then solve this equation by substituting our known values to find out what would happen if there was an inconsistency in purchasing additional fruit.\n\n(3* 33) -x \n=99-x\nThis is the amount left after buying fewer apples than kiwis. Now we will use a different method of solving, which involves finding how much he purchased compared to his original number and using that information as our new total for both items.\n   \nNew Kiwi = Initial Kiwi + Additional Purchase (which was 66)\n=33+66\n=99\n\nTo find the amount left after purchasing fewer apples than kiwis we will use:\n   New Apples = Initial Amount - Decrease in Apples \n\nSince there are three times as many initially, and he purchased a total of less items compared to his original count (which was 3 * Kiwi). We can set up an equation with the information that has been provided:\n\nNew apples = \n(Initial amount) + new purchase\n= Initial Amount - Decrease in Apples \n\nSince we know this will give us our final answer, let's find out what would happen if he purchased fewer than kiwis (and had three times as many initially). We can then solve the equation by substituting our known values.\n\nNew apples = \n(3 * 99) - x\n=297-x\n\nHowever since we know that his original number was already given, let's use a different method of solving to find out if there are any inconsistencies or errors in what has been provided. \n\nNow we will solve this equation by substituting our known values:\n\nNew kiwi = \n33+66\n=99\n\nTo find the amount left after purchasing fewer apples than kiwis (and had three times as many initially), let's set up an equation with new information that was given.\n\nSince he purchased 48 less, we can use this to solve for 'x' in our previous equations:\n   x = Decrease \n=48",

Mohammed had ten times as many oranges as plums initially (before buying more):\n   Number of oranges before buying = 10 * initial number of plums \n = 10 * 82\n = 820 oranges \n\n4. He bought 37 fewer oranges than the new total number of plums:\n   - New total number of plums after buying = 133\n   Therefore, he must have bought: \n   (new total number of plums) - (number of oranges bought)\n   Number of oranges before and after are both unknowns so we will call them X.\n   So the equation would be like this:\n   \n   X + 37 = new total number of plums\n         X + 37 = 133\n   \n5. Solve for X to find out how many oranges he had initially (before buying)\n   - X + 37 = 133 \n   Subtracting 37 from both sides gives us: \n   -X = 96 \n   Multiplying by (-1) on both sides:\n    -(-x)=-(+96)\n      x=96\n   \n6. Now we know that initially there were 820 oranges and he bought fewer than the total number of plums (133).\n7.

Mohammed bought fewer than this amount, so we need to subtract:\n    - Number of oranges he had initially from the above equation:   \n      New total number of oranges after buying = initial number of oranges + (number of oranges bought)\n = x + (x+37)\n\n10 Now that we have a value for X and know how many more oranges were purchased, \n     we can calculate new total by adding these two values together:\n    - Therefore the equation would be like this:  \n      New total number of oranges after buying = initial number of oranges + Number of additional oranges\n = x + (x+37)\n = 2(x) + 37\n\n11 Now that we know how many more oranges were purchased, \n     plug in our known value for X and solve the equation:\n    - New total number of oranges after buying = initial number of oranges + Number of additional oranges\n = x + (x+37)\n = 2(x) + 37  \n = 2(96) + 37\n\n12 Calculate new total by solving this expression: \n    - Therefore the equation would be like this:\n      New Total after buying more plums and fewer oranges is equal to\n       192 + 37 \n\n13 Now that we have a value for X, calculate new combined total of number of oranges and plums Mohammed has in his house.\n   - Plums = Initial Number of Plums + Additional Plums \n           = 82 + 51\n           = 133\n   New Total after buying more plums and fewer oranges is equal to:\n     (initial number of oranges) + (new total number of oranges)\n    Therefore the equation would be like this:   \n       new combined total of number of oranges and plums \n         = x + (2(x)+37)\n\n14 Now that we know how many more oranges were purchased, plug in our known value for X and solve the equation:\n   - New Combined Total after buying more is equal to\n     96+192\n\n15 Calculate new combined total by solving this expression: \n    - Therefore the equation would be like this:\n      New Combined Total = Initial number of plums + initial number of oranges + additional Plums + additional Oranges bought.\n                         Since we have a value for X (initial number of oranges), let's plug in our known values and solve.  \n        new combined total of number of oranges and plums \n          = 96+192\n         = New Total after buying more\n\n16 Now that we know how many more oranges were purchased, calculate the final answer:\n    - Therefore the equation would be like this",

Since we know that initially, for every pear there were five bananas:\n- The difference between the total number of pears before buying more (49) is used as a multiplier\n    - We have 70 extra pears and since Jamal has 39 fewer bananas then this means that: \n        - He bought 70 + 39 = 109 less in banana's.\n   So we can calculate how many the total number of banannas are by multiplying (49) with five and subtracting 109:\n- New total of bananas = Initial total * multiplier - difference\n    - We have a initial value for our new calculation: \n        - Total before buying more pears is equal to : 245 \n     Now we can calculate the result after he buys less banana's then pears.\n   So now, let us do that:\n- New number of bananas = (5 * Initial total) - Difference\n    - We have our numbers.

      "raw": "\n\nTo solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Keisha wants to spend €180 in total.\n2. She needs:\n   - A round of laser tag for herself (€6) and each friend she invites\n   - Pinball tokens worth €7\n   - To ride the roller coaster twice\n\n3. First, we need to calculate how much money is spent on pinball tokens: \n   - Money spent = 180 - cost of pinball tokens \n\n4. Let's assign 'x' as number of friends she invites:\n   - Cost for laser tag (including herself) will be €6 * x\n   - Roller coaster rides twice would be 2 times the price per ride, which is €32\n\n5. The total amount spent on these activities can now be represented by: \n   - Money Spent = cost of pinball tokens + (€6*x) for laser tag and roller coasters \n\nLet's express this mathematically:\nMoney Spent = 7 + 6x + 32\nMoney Spent = 39 + 6x\n\nWe are given that money spent is €180. So, we can write an equation: \n- 39 + 6x = 180\n\nNow let's solve for 'x'. We subtract 39 from both sides of the equation:\n   - 6x = 141\nThen divide by 6 on each side to isolate x.\n   - x = (141/6)\nWe can simplify this fraction and find out how many friends she could invite: \n- x ≈ 23.5\n\nHowever, since we cannot have a fractional number of people invited, the problem is asking for an integer value.\n\nTherefore, let's consider only whole numbers because you cannot invite half or any other non-whole amount of guests to the party.\nWe can try both options (round down and round up) from our result.",

The go-karts cost ¥13 a ride. How many friends can she invite?\\n\\nStep 1: Calculate total expenses for Emma herself.\\nEmma wants to play one round of mini-golf (¥6), have ¥5 in arcade tokens, and get to ride the go-karts three times (3 x ¥13 = ¥39). So her total expense will be ¥6 + ¥5 + ¥39 = ¥50. This means she has ¥250 - ¥50 = ¥200 left for friends.\\n\\nStep 2: Determine how much each friend can spend and calculate the number of friends Emma can invite with ¥200 budgeted for them.\\nThe cost per round of mini-golf is ¥6, but since they want to play only one time, this will not be a factor in our calculation. The go-karts cost ¥13 per ride (3 rides = ¥39), and she needs at least ¥5 for arcade tokens. So the minimum amount each friend can spend would be ¥39 + ¥5 = ¥44.\\nHowever, if we calculate how many friends Emma could invite with this budget, it would not work out because of our previous calculation that left her only ¥200 after accounting for herself (which was a total expense of ¥50). Since the minimum each friend can spend is ¥44 and she has ¥200 to give them all together, let's divide 200 by 44.\\n\\nStep 3: Perform division of 200 ÷ 44.\\nThe result will be approximately 4.545 (rounded down since we cannot invite a fraction of friends). However, the problem doesn't allow for fractions and it makes more sense to round down so that she can give each friend at least ¥5 in arcade tokens and ride them three times on the go-karts without going over budget.\\n\\nStep 4: Calculate final answer based upon division result from Step 3. Since we are rounding down, Emma could invite a maximum of 4 friends.\"}\n    ",

Calculate the total cost for bumper cars:\n   - Cost per ride = ₣6\n   - Number of rides = 7 times \n   - Total bumper car cost = 7 * ₣6 = ₣42\n\n3. Add up all costs, including game room tokens and bowling/bumper cars to see how much money is spent in total.\n   - Game room token budget for Jasmine's friends (Jasmine will not use the remaining funds) would be subtracted from this amount\n   - Total cost of the party = ₣40 + ₣42 = ₣82\n\n4. Subtract the costs calculated above and tokens used by her, to see how much money she has left after buying all that stuff.\n   - Remaining budget for friends (tokens not included) would be subtracted from this amount\n   - Total remaining funds in Jasmine's account = ₣250 - ₣82  -3 \n   - This gives us a total of: ₣165\n\n5. Determine the number of friends she can invite:\n   - Since we've already accounted for her own bowling, token costs and bumper car rides (for herself), let’s calculate how many more game room tokens are available to buy.\n   - Total remaining funds = ₣165\n   - Tokens Jasmine's dad has budgeted for: 3 \n   - Budget left after buying all those things is subtracting this from the total amount of money she had in her account. This gives us a value that represents how many more tokens are available to buy.\n    Remaining token funds (to be allocated among friends) = ₣165 - 3\n     We can now see how much budget remains for Jasmine's friend game room tokens: \n   - Budget remaining for other stuff, and also the number of additional tokens we have in total that she could spend on her friends is subtracted from this amount.\n\n6. Determine how many more tokens are available to buy:\n    Remaining token funds (to be allocated among friends) = ₣165 – 3\n     We can now see how much budget remains for Jasmine's friend game room tokens: \n   - Budget remaining for other stuff, and also the number of additional tokens we have in total that she could spend on her friends is subtracted from this amount.\n\n7. Calculate the maximum number of friends:\n    Number of friends = (Total remaining funds / Cost per token) – 1\n     Since Jasmine can't invite herself to a party with game room tokens, we need to subtract one from our answer.\n   - Total remaining funds for her to buy all those things is ₣165 \n   - Each friend gets ₣3 of the budgeted funds. This leaves us:   \n    Number of friends = (₣165 / 3) –1",

      "raw": "{\"The final answer is \\boxed{3}. \" :\") Here's the solution to the problem in a step-by-step format. This will ensure that we can accurately determine how many friends Elena can invite within her budget of $190 and also get all the other things she wants for her birthday party which are bowling, game room tokens, bumper cars rides etc. We have several steps below: 1. Determine how much money is left over after buying one round of bowling ($8) per person (including herself). Let's say there are 'x' friends invited. This will be $190 - $8 * x - $3 for game room tokens and $84 spent on bumper cars rides which costs $12 each, 7 times = $12 * 7 = $84. Then the total cost would be: Total Cost = $8 (bowling) +$84 (bumper car rides) + $3 (game room tokens). So we have to find 'x' for this equation below: $190 - ($8 * x + $84 + $3 ) > 0, or simply put as $103 - $8*x>0. This simplifies further into the following inequality: 8*x<103 and then dividing by both sides of the above inequality gives us this result (x < 12.875). Since we can't invite a fraction of friends so x must be less than 13 which is equal to having at least 3 or more friends invited. Now, let's assume that Elena invites all her friends she could possibly have for her birthday party and see if it fits within the budget limit: Let's say there are 'x' number of people (friends + herself) = x+1 at the party then total cost would be $8 * x +$84 + $3. So we can write this as an equation below to find out how many friends she could invite and still stay within her budget limit: $190 - ($8*x+$84+$3)>0 or simply put, 103-($8*$x)>0 then dividing by both sides of the above inequality gives us x<12.875 which is less than 13. Therefore we can say that at least one more friend could be invited to this party and still stay within her budget limit (if she invites all friends possible). Now, let's see how many people are there when 'x' number of friends are present: There will be x+1 people if Elena invites \" ,\". Let's find the maximum value for this expression which is less than or equal to $190 after buying one round bowling per person and bumper cars rides seven times (costing each ride at$12) and also have game room tokens worth $3: We can write an equation below as follows: Total Cost = 8x +84+3, where x represents the number of friends invited. And we know that this total cost is less than or equal to budget limit which is $190 So let's put it into a simple inequality expression like so:$103 - ($8 * x)>0 then dividing by both sides gives us (x < 12.875) Now, since you can't invite fraction of people and also we know that this value for 'x' should be less than 13 which is equal to at least having 3 friends invited or more in the party. So now let's assume Elena invites all her possible number of friends she could have then see if it fits within budget limit: Let's say there are x+1 people (friends + herself) present and total cost for them would be $8 * x +$84+$3 We can write equation as follows to find how many friends invited still stays with in the budget limit:$190 - ($8*$x+$84+$3)>0 or simply put, 103-($8* )>0 then dividing by both sides gives us (12.875) which is less than 13 . Therefore we can say that at least one more friend could be invited to this party and still stay within her budget limit if she invites all friends possible. So let's find the maximum value of x+1 where total cost ($8x +$84+$3)is equal or less than $190: We have an equation below as follows:$103 - ( 8 * x ) >0, then dividing by both sides gives us this result (12.875). Since we can't invite a fraction of people so 'x' must be at most 13 which is equal to having 3 or more friends invited for the party. So now let's assume Elena invites all her possible number of friends she could have and see if it fits within budget limit: Let's say there are x+1 (friends + herself) present in total, then cost would be $8 * x+$84+$3 We can write equation as follows to find how many friends invited still stays with in the budget limit:$190 - ($8*$x+$84+$3)>0 or simply",

Now that we know their individual daily production rates (Nia: 91 customers/day and Xena: 728 customers/day), let's calculate the total number of days in a week:\n   - A standard week has 7 working days, assuming they work every day of the week.\n\n4. To find out their combined weekly production rate, we need to add up Nia's daily output (91) and Xena's daily output (728), then multiply by the total number of working days in a week:\n   - Combined daily production = 91 + 728 = 819 customers/day\n   - Weekly production for both employees = combined_daily_production * weekly_days = 819 * 7\n\n5.
