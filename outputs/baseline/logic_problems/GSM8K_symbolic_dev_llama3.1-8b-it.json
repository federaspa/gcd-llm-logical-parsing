This is done by adding 23 (video game players) and 41 (volleyball enthusiasts), which equals 64.\n2. Since there are a total of 157 students in this group, we need to subtract the ones that already have their hobbies chosen from these options. So, let's find out how many like either hike or paint by doing: \n   Total number of students - (Number who play video games + Number who play volleyball) =  \n   157 - 64 = 93.\n3. Now we know there are a total of 93 that prefer to do something between hiking and painting, but the question only asks for those people that like 'hiking'. We have been given information stating \"the number that like to paint is twice the number that prefer playing volleyball\". Since it's known they all either hike or paint (not both), if we know how many of each group there are then 93 will be equal to: \n   Number who prefer hiking + Twice the number who play Volleyball.\n4. Let x = The total amount people in this scenario like volley ball, so\n   x *2 is equivalent for 'the twice that volleyball players', or \"twice the number that prefer playing volleyball\" since it was specified as such above \n5. With this information we can solve the equation by using the following:  \n   Number who hike + (x* 2) =93.\n6. The total amount of people in a group is x, therefore if there are two groups then:\n   number hiking+number painting= 93\n7. It also says that 'the rest like to either hike or paint.' So the \"rest\" means: \n8. There will be as many people doing one thing and another, but not both (like in this case), so it is stated by previous knowledge about groups.\n9. The amount of hiking enthusiasts can now be found from:\n   93 - x *2 = number that prefer to hike\n10. Given the statement \"the rest like to either hike or paint\", we know there are only two options here, therefore: \n    This makes us able to solve this problem because if there is a total of 41 who enjoy volleyball and they double it up (i.e., x *2), then that would equal to people painting.\n11. If all the groups were known except for 'number hiking' in these three scenarios, we could find out how many students like hiking by solving this equation:\n    Number who prefer playing Volleyball + Twice the number of volleyball enthusiasts = Total amount who hike or paint\n12. Since it has been found that there are 41 players participating in volley ball then \n13. If you substitute x with a value (in other words, plug-in) for an answer to this problem:\n    x *2 + Number hiking =93.\n14. By taking into account all the prior knowledge from previous steps, we can find out how many students like 'hiking' by plugging 41 in as \"x\" which is equal to volleyball enthusiasts and solving it using algebraic reasoning\n15. This would be:\n   (41*2)+number hiking=93\n16. The solution for this equation will give the answer of how many people participate in activities related to 'hiking'\n17. After evaluating both sides, we find out that number hiking is 11\n\nAnswer: \nThe final answer is 13",

Then in the next 30 seconds (total of 60 seconds), 2 times that amount popped so 80 x 2 = 160 kernels popped in this period.\n3. The total number of kernels popped up to now is: \n   - First 30 seconds: 80\n   - Next 30 seconds: 160\n   Total popping till the end of second set of 30 seconds (at a rate twice as fast) is, therefore:\n   - 80 + 160 = 240\n\n4. In the next period, they pop at four times that amount in each 30-second block so for this time frame: \n    - Popping rate increased by factor of 4 over previous\n    So number popped in third set is (initial popping * 2) x 4:\n        Initial was a 80 kernels and doubled to 160 then quadrupled the new base to get 640.\n5. The total number of kernels popped up till now, including this period: \n   - Previous popping: 240\n   New rate for third set (the 30 seconds with increased rate): 640\n6. Total so far is previous + latest:\n    240+640 = 880\n\n7. In the next 30 seconds, the kernels pop at half that rate compared to before.\n8. Half of this period's popping rate would be: \n   - (previous set) /2 : So number popped in fourth and final set was\n     half of what we have for last block which is half of (initial *4).\n    Since initial 30 seconds gave a count of kernels as 80,\n    then doubling that to get the next rate results in: \n        - Initial doubled = 160.\n   So, halved from quadrupled base would be:\n      Quadruple the popped number at end of second set (which was initially doubled) /2\n     Therefore half is calculated by taking this value and dividing it by two so we have a popping rate as follows: \n        - Halving the 640 gives us our answer in next block which equals to 320\n\n9. The total number of kernels popped up till now, including this period:\n    Total previous (till third set) + latest (last one): \n   - Previous : 880\n   New rate for fourth set: 320.\n10. Now we calculate the new total popping by adding both counts together to get final answer in terms of total number popped up till now so far as follows:\n    Total = previous+latest= 880 + 320\n\n11. We have been told that after taking pan off heat, a quarter of kernels from last set pop due to residual heating.\n12. From the fourth and latest popping period (which is also final), we had: \n   - Number popped in this time frame as was calculated previously which equals 320.\n\n13. A quarter of those would be:\n    This can now be easily done by dividing that number, found earlier for last set or block by a factor of four to find the answer.\n14. Since (a/4) represents one fourth times value 'a', we have here \n   - (the popping in this time frame)/ 4\n     = 320 / 4 \n\n15. Calculating that will give us: \n    Residual popped kernels, so final is total till now + residual:\n16. The answer to our question about how many pieces of popcorn does Santiago eat can be calculated as follows and must take into account both the popping during heat application in terms of four different 30-second intervals for this particular scenario with additional number from post heating too.\n17. To calculate that, we need add up total popped so far: \n    - Till now (from previous sets): Total till now is 880 +320 =1200\n   - Plus the final count after removing a quarter of what was in last block due to heat transfer which gives us our answer for this part as follows:\n     To find that, we need divide by four.\n18. Final calculation can be done like so: \n    First, calculate how many popped at end from residual heating and add up both totals (during cooking + post heating) together.\n\n19. We have calculated the total till now to get 1200 for all popping before removing a quarter of what was left in last block.\n20. A fourth of kernels that were left would be:\n    - Total popped during heat application /4: \n   Which is equal to\n     - (320)/4\n\n21. The final count, including both totals from previous and post heating will then give the total number so we need add them together now in order to get an answer as follows:\n- So that gives us our 1200 + (320/4) for a grand total of kernels popped.\n\n22.

We are told that a total of 1332 teaspoons (sugar + water) were used.\n3. Let's first find the common multiplier for both numbers in the ratio by finding their greatest common divisor. \n   The greatest common divisor between 128 and 20 is 4, so we can multiply each number in the ratio by 4 to get a total of 512 (sugar) + 80 (water).\n4. However since this doesn't equal our known sum of teaspoons used which was stated as being 1332; let's instead use both parts of that equation directly and divide it out.\n   Let s be the number of sugar teaspoons, w = the water cups then we have:\n   (s / 128) : (w / 20) = 1:0.1556\n5. This isn't super useful as is so instead let's get rid of decimals by multiplying each part of our ratio by 100 to make it easier.\n   Now, the ratio becomes s/12,800 : w/2000 and since we have (s+w)/1332 = \n6. We know that the total amount used was 1332 teaspoons so now let's isolate 'w' using substitution:\n    (total - s) / 2000\n7. Now substitute for total: \n   ((1332-s) / 2000)\n8. Next we can use this to solve for 's'. So, the ratio is still that of s/12800 : w/2000.\n9. We set up our equation with these values as (total - s)/w = 1332/w-2000 and simplify it:\n   ((1332-s) / (s/12,800)) = \n10 Then we multiply both sides by the denominator to get rid of that fraction which will look something like this: \n    (1332-s)*12800\n11 Next divide each side by 100 to clean up some clutter and see what we have left.\n   Now it looks more manageable with our equation, let's simplify further:\n12 To do so multiply the whole number out on one side. Multiply 16 * s = (21,331200 -1332*12800) then subtract both sides by this new value to find your answer for 's'.\n    This results in: \n   16*s= 21331200-170060800\n13 So now you can simplify that left-hand side of the equation.\n14 By dividing each term on our right-hand side, we will arrive at an integer number which should represent sugar teaspoons used by Sophia. \n\nAnswer: The final answer is -1551116000",

To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used, multiply the total amount by the sugar fraction:\n   Teaspoonfuls of sugar = Total amount * Sugar fraction\n                         = 1458 * (147/243)\n\nAnswer: The final answer is $\\boxed{823}$",

Next, let's determine what fraction of the total mixture is sugar using the given ratio (28 teaspoons to a total of 52).\n   We can represent this as 28/52 or simplify it further by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor which in this case is 4.\n   So we get 7/13.\n\n3. Since Nadia used a total of 1352 teaspoons (which are the sugar-tea mixture), to find out how much was sugar, we multiply that number with our fraction for sugar content:\n   This results in:  (28 / 52) * 1352\n\n4.

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n1. Let's denote the number of muffin boxes sold on Tuesday as M_T and pomegranate pie boxes sold on Wednesday as P_W.\n2. Since Jamal sold 19 fewer boxes of pomegranate pie than on Wednesday, we can write an equation: \nP_W - 19 = P_T (where P_T is the number of pomegranate pie boxes sold on Tuesday)\n3. We are given that he sold 14 more boxes of muffins than on Tuesday:\nM_W = M_T + 14\n4. Also, we know that the number of muffin boxes sold on Wednesday was not directly provided but it can be found from the equation (2) and expressed in terms of P_T as follows: \nWe need to first solve for the unknown variable which is the pomegranate pie box sales for Tuesday.\nSo M_W = 24 + 14\n5. After solving equations, we know that:\nP_W - 19 = P_T\nand from equation (2) and given data on Wednesday's muffin boxes \nM_W = 38.\nNow let us determine the value of unknown variable which is pomegranate pie box sales for Tuesday using above information: Since Jamal sold a total of 24 + M_T boxes on Tuesday, it follows that\nP_T = P_W - 19. To find out how many muffins were sold we first have to know what number was the value of pomegranates.\nBut this is only true if he sells (38) boxs in Wednsday. So now using given data \nM_T + M_W must be equal to total sales on Tuesday which will also help us find out how many boxes were sold for both days: \n24  and then the number of pomegranate pie boxes we can calculate as follows.\nP_W = P_T+19\nSo from above equation, let's denote P_W - 19 is M_T +14. We know that:\nM_T + (M_T + 14) should be equal to total muffin sales on Tuesday: \n24 and this means that the value of unknown variable for both days will also help us find out how many boxes were sold in wednsday\nP_W = P_T+19, M_W=M_T+14.\n6. Solving these equations we can now determine:\nM_T + (M_T + 14) is equal to total muffin sales on Tuesday which should be: \n24 and this means that the value of unknown variable for both days will also help us find out how many boxes were sold in wednsday\nP_W = P_T+19, M_W=M_T+14.\n7. From equation (2) we can see that:\nM_W - 38 should be equal to total muffin sales on Tuesday \nwhich is:24 and this means the value of unknown variable for both days will also help us find out how many boxes were sold in wednsday\nP_W = P_T+19, M_W=M_T+14.\n8. Solving equations:\nWe can calculate that Jamal sold 5 muffins on Tuesday (M_T=5).\n9. Therefore,\nJamal's sales of pomegranate pie for Wednesday was: \n24 boxes + 5 \nwhich is equal to 29\n10. Using the above information we know that \nthe total number of boxs which were sold in wednsday must be:\nP_W = P_T+19, M_W=M_T+14.\n11. We can calculate that Jamal's sales on Tuesday was: \n¥ (8 * 5) + ¥(28*4)\n12. Therefore,\nJamal earned for two days:\n¥(40+112)=\nAnswer: The final answer is $152.",

We know that Mohammed sold 18 fewer boxes of orange pie than on Thursday, so the equation for oranges is: OrW = OrTh - 18\n   Also, he sold 13 more boxes of muffin than on Wednesday, so the equation for muffins is: MuW = MuTh + 13 \n3. From the problem statement we know that:\n- On Wednesday: W (Muffin) = 23 and OrW = ? - which can be expressed as a function of Th.\n   So OrW = OrTh - 18\n4. Similarly, on Thursday he sold: MuTh + 13 boxes for muffins and 24 boxes for orange pie:\n- Therefore we have the following equations to solve this problem \n   (1) 23 = W = MuW – 13 or W = MuW – 13 so we can substitute value in equation from point number two\n   And then use our knowledge of algebra, which is that if a=b and c=a+5 ,then c=b+5.\n   Let’s apply this here:\n(2) OrTh -18=OrW \n   \nTo solve for the actual numbers, let's set up an expression using (1). We already know from problem statement that 23 boxes of muffin were sold on Wednesday. Using our knowledge we can substitute value in equation and then use algebra to get result.\n\nSince we have: W = MuTh +13\n   Therefore by substituting the actual number which is given as per question.\n   This comes out to be (MuW -13) \n  Hence, after doing some basic math this results into:\n(1) or value of mu w – 13=23 i.e. muw =36 and now we can easily find that how much orange pie boxes were sold on Wednesday by substituting the known values in equation mentioned at point number (2).\nHence: OrW=OrTh -18 \n    And, OrTh=MuW+13-10\n     Therefore after doing some math it comes out to be 36 + 13 – 10 =39\n\nNow we know that on Wednesday Mohammed sold 23 boxes of muffin and On Thursday he also sold (24) boxes for orange pie. As per problem statement, We can easily find the number of Muffins box by substituting value in equation which is already mentioned at point number one.\nTherefore using our knowledge from step two:\nW = MuTh +13\nHence on Wednesday he sold 36-10=26 muffin boxes and On Thursday he also had (39+18) i.e. total of 57 orange pie box.\n\nNow we know that Mohammed has the following data \n   - He sold: 23 boxes for Muffins and OrW =39 – 18 which is equal to oranges on Wednesday.\n    And, MuTh +13=36 i.e., he also had (26) muffin boxes on Thursday\n     Also On Thursday, total of (24+57) i.e. a total of 81 orange pie box.\n\nNow we can calculate the money that Mohammed earned \n   - Muffins sold = Total number of Muffin * price per Muffin.\n    So, for Wednesday it is: $10*23 and on Thursday: MuTh +13=36 which equals to (26) so he also had 26 muffin boxes. Hence the total money from muffins \n      For two days will be = ($10*$23+$21*(39-18)) i.e., Muffin money is equal to $230+378=$608\n   - Similarly, orange pies sold: Total number of oranges * price per Orange Pie.\n     So for Wednesday he had (39 – 18) and on Thursday we already have value which equals to total of 81 so the actual equation becomes:\n    ($21*(57)) +$10*26 =$1,197+$260=$1457.\n\nNow that we know how many boxes were sold each day and their respective costs \n   - The money he earned can be easily found out by adding both these values. i.e., Total Money Earned = Muffin Money + Orange Pie.\n    Hence the total earnings for two days is equal to ($608+$1457=$2065).\n\nAnswer: $2065",

Let's assume her speed on the beach is x miles per minute.\n3. Since she walks at two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach, her speed on the sidewalk would be 2x miles per minute.\n4. On the beach, Zahra spends 60 minutes walking a total distance of 15 miles. So we can calculate her speed as follows:\n   Speed (on the beach) = Total Distance / Time\n                        = 15 miles / 1 hour \n                        Since there are 60 min in one hour then \n                       = 15/60 or 0.25 mph, now let's convert it into mile per minute.\n                     so we have x=0.25/60 since she walks on the beach at this speed\n5. Now that we know her speed (x), and knowing that her speed is two times faster when walking on the sidewalk then:\n   Speed (on the sidewalk) = 2 * (speed of beach)\n                            = 2 * x \n                            = 0.25*2/60 miles per minute, so this means it takes a fraction for one mile to be covered.\n6. Let's assume t minutes is the time taken by Zahra to cover 15 miles on her sidewalk walk and also let s denote speed of beach in mph\n   Speed (on the sidewalk) = Total Distance / Time \n                           = 15/s *t \n                           Now, we know that it takes two times less when walking on a sidewalk.\n7.

Since she walks at the same rate for both (beach and sidewalk) then let's assume t is equal to time taken by her in order to complete the entire walk.\n   Then we have:\n   2*(speed of beach)*60/0.25=s *t or s/t=30 mph\n9. The total distance covered on the sidewalk will be: (speed*t)=(15/s) *s \n    We know that she walks at a rate for both places, then let's assume t is equal to time taken by her in order to complete the entire walk.\n   Then we have:\n  Total Distance = Speed*Time\n                 For beach=0.25/60*30 and for sidewalk (2*(speed of beach)*t)/1=(15/s) *s \n10.

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \n1. First, let's find the time it takes for Beatriz to walk on the beach and on the sidewalk separately.\n   - Since 54 minutes of her total walking time is spent on the beach, we can represent this as (beach_time / beach_total_time) = (18 miles / 28 miles), where beach_total_time represents the fraction of the total distance that Beatriz walks on the beach. We need to use these two ratios in order to calculate both times.\n   - We know she spends x minutes walking on the sidewalk, so her time for walking on the beach is 54 minutes and her speed on the beach (b) * this time equals the miles walked on it which would be equal to 18 miles. \n   \n2. Now let's represent her speeds in terms of one variable.\n   - Let 's denote Beatriz' s speed as b for walking on the beach, then she walks at a rate of 2b when walking on the sidewalk.\n\n3. The time it takes for her to walk each segment is equal to distance/speed (time = d/v) and since we are working with variables here we'll say that t_b represents 'her time spent' in minutes while walking on the beach, therefore b*t_b = 18 miles.\n   - We can use this same formula for the sidewalk part of her walk: s is denoted as speed (2b), then x/t_s equals 10 where t_s is the total amount of time Beatriz walks at that particular speed.\n\n4. Now let's solve these equations to determine how long each segment takes.\n   - b*t_b =18\n   - We already know this one since we've been given it (54 minutes).\n   \n5. For sidewalk, 2b * x/60=10 which is solved for variable t_s or time on the walkway \n6. Solving these two equations results in the following:\nt_b=54 min and then finding an equivalent expression of this equation by substitution to find that\n    - t_s = (100) / b   minutes spent walking at sidewalk speed 2b\n\n7. Then, since it was given she walks 18 miles on beach while her time is 54 which is equal to the distance divided by rate therefore,\n     a= 18/b \n    - Substituting for 'a', we have t_s = (100) / b * (18/28)/(b)\n8. This can be simplified as follows:\n   - The expression simplifies to:  \nt_b + t_s\n(54)+(3000/(2*72))   \n9. Simplify the fraction and add it up.\n \nAnswer: 78",

First, let's determine the time it takes for Kayla to walk 19 kilometers on the beach and 12 kilometers on the sidewalk in terms of speed.\n\nLet x be her walking speed on the beach (in km/h).\nThen, her walking speed on the sidewalk is 2x (since she walks at two times the rate).\n\nSince distance = speed * time,\ntime taken to walk 19km on the beach is 19 / x hours\nand \ntime taken for 12 kilometers of sidewalk is 12 / (2x) hours.\n\nHowever, we are given that 57 minutes were spent walking on the beach. \n\nWe first need to convert this into hours: 57/60 = 0.95.\nThis means it took Kayla approximately .95 hours or about \n(19/x)*((1 hour)/(1 hour)) * (x/(3600 minutes))(180) minute  \n=   33 / x.\n\n3. Since time taken for beach + sidewalk is equal to total walktime, then let's determine the value of 'x'.\nWe already know that it took .95 hours = (19/x), which means \n(19/x)*((1 hour)/(1 hour)) * (x/(3600 minutes))(180) minute  \n= 33 / x.\nLet's use this equation to find out how long she takes for the sidewalk walk. \n\nTime spent on beach + time spent on the sidewalk = total time\nSo, we know that \n(19/x)*((1 hour)/(1 hour)) * (x/(3600 minutes))(180) minute  \n= 33 / x and ((12/2x)((1 hour)/ (1 hour))(x /(3600 min )))(60)min is the sidewalk portion of time. \n\nWe can then find out how long she takes for her walk by simply adding up this equation: \n(19/x)*((1 hour)/(1 hour)) * (x/(3600 minutes))(180 minute)\n+ ((12/2x)((1 hour)/ (1 hour))(x /(3600 min )))(60)min\n\nwhich is\n33 / x + 36o /x = total walk time.\n\nSince we know she walks at two times the rate of speed on sidewalk than beach, her walking speed for sidewalk portion will be twice as fast and that means it takes half as long.  \nIf (57 minutes)/((19 km)/(1km)) is approximately equal to \n33/x,\nand 12/2x is about half that time, then we can say\nthat the total walktime = (.95 + .58)*60 min which comes out to be 62.8.\nBut since you are given a problem in minutes and have not defined x yet (but it has been defined as walking speed on beach) I am going to try another method.\n\n4. Since we know that \n57 minute walk is approximately equal to about (.95 hours)*(3600 min)/(1 hour), then\nwe can also say the time for 12 km of sidewalk will be about ((36/2x)*((60)/ (1hour)))( x / (1 hr) )*(1hr/(180 minutes)). \nWe are now going to find out how long this is in terms of speed.\n\nLet's call her walking speed 's'.  \nThen, we know that\ndistance = rate * time.\nThis means 12 km equals the sidewalk distance can be expressed as follows:\n(2*s)*((60/1 hr)) *(x/(3600 min ))* (180 minutes)\nNow let us go back to step three and see how much of a difference it makes if we use this method.\n\n3.

Let's denote the speed at which Xena walks on the beach as 'b' miles per minute and her speed walking on the sidewalk as 5b, since she is five times faster.\n2. Since distance equals rate multiplied by time (d = rt), we can calculate the time spent on both parts of the trail:\n   a) Time spent walking on the beach: d1 / r1 = 11 miles / b\n   b) Time spent walking on the sidewalk: d2 / r2 = 10 miles / 5b \n3. The total walk is divided into these two times, so we can create an equation that represents Xena's entire trip:\n   Total time of the trip in minutes equals (time spent on beach + time spent on sidewalk) or (11/b) + (10/5b).\n4. We are told 66 minutes out of her total walk is spent walking on the beach, so we can write an equation that represents this information: \n    1 / b * 11 = 66.\n   This will be used to find 'b', Xena's speed in miles per minute when she walks on the beach. \n5. Now let us solve for b:\n   First multiply both sides of our equation by b (to eliminate division):\n      11 = 66b\n    Then divide each side of this new equation by 66, to isolate 'b':\n       b = 11 / 66.\n6. Having the speed at which Xena walks on her beach ('b' or approximately .16666667), we can use it in our prior formula (Total time of the trip) that is: \n   Total walk duration equals ((time spent walking on the beach + time spent walking on sidewalk)):\n    11 / b * (1/60 minutes per minute) + (10/(5*b)) * (1/minute).\n7. This will be used to find total duration in minutes of Xena's entire trip:\n   Total walk duration = ((66*60)/11) + (12/((5*(11/66)))) \n8. Since we have all the necessary information, let us plug them into our equation.\n9. Evaluate this expression using order operations and convert 66/(1/minute) to minutes by multiplying it with the rate in which Xena walks on the beach: \n   First calculate (12 / ((5 * b))) = (12 /((5*(11/66)))) then multiply both sides of our equation for time spent walking on sidewalk, or (time walked on sidewalk), 10 miles times the speed she is going when she walks on that part by one minute per mile and add this to it:\n     Total walk duration equals ((60*66)/11) + (12 /((5*(11/66)))) * (1/(minute)).\n\nLet us evaluate this expression, step-by-step:\n\nFirst let's compute the fraction 10 miles divided by speed of sidewalk in miles/min \n   since b = 11/66 and we can plug it into our equation to get a number for Xena's rate at which she walks on her favorite beach:\n    (12 / ((5*(11/66)))) * (1/(minute)) is equivalent to:  \n     (60*66) / (11 + (((10)/(11/66))*((1/min)))) \n    = 3600 - (660*6)/77\n   Next, let's calculate this number:\n      Total walk duration equals ((60*66)/11) + (12 /((5*(11/66)))) * (1/(minute))\n        ≈ 3600-48.\n10.

The question asked how long the entire walk took, so let's go back to our time expression from earlier: Total Time spent on Beach + Total time Spent on Sidewalk\n=Total Walk time \nNow convert this into minutes by multiplying it with 60:\n(31/x) * (660/2)\nFirst multiply numerator and Denominator of each term together, then cancel out common factors\n=( (11*330)+(9*(165)))/ x  \nThen the equation becomes: \n=((3630 +1485 ) /x )\nMultiplying numerator and denominator together to combine terms:\n(5115/x) hours * 60 minutes/hour = ((3.1 ×10^4)/(2×10))minutes\nMultiply both sides by ' (2*10)' for x, multiply the left-hand side's fraction: \n((6.22 × 10 ^3)/x)=   ( 0 )\nNow divide numerator and denominator of each term together:\n(5115 /1 )/ ((660/ 2)*60) = (51150)/(39600)\nDividing both sides by ' x' to find the total time in minutes: \n((6.22 ×10^3)/x)=   0 \n\nMultiplying numerator and Denominator of each term together, then divide by common factors:\n= 1\nTo calculate this expression we need an answer for (51150 /39600). Dividing both sides gives us the final time in minutes: \n(6.22 ×10^3) hours *60/((660/2 )hours)*60 = ((5.125×10 ^4)/ ((33*10)))\nNow divide numerator and denominator of each term together:\n=  (1.5499 /0.99)\nMultiply both sides by 'x' to find the value for x \n(51150/39600) *((2*x )minutes)=(660/60)*   ((6.22 ×10^3)/x )\nWe know that this expression is equal to our equation  (1.5499 /0.99)=5.\nTo get rid of 'x' on the left-hand side, divide by",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \n\n1. Let's denote Mei's speed on the beach as x miles per minute.\n2. Since she walks at two times this rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.\n3. The distance covered while walking on the beach can be calculated using the formula Distance = Speed × Time. We know that Mei spends 60 minutes on the beach and covers a certain distance (15 miles). So we have: \n   15 = x * 60\n4. Solving for x, we get:\n   x = 15 / 60\n5. Now let's find her speed on the sidewalk using the value of x from step 4.\n6. Speed on the beach is already calculated as (x) which equals to 0.25 miles/minute and since she walks at two times this rate on the sidewalk, we have:\n   Speed = 2 * x\n        = 2 * (15 / 60)\n7. The time it takes for Mei to cover 28 miles can be calculated by adding up the individual walking distances of beach and sidewalk.\n8. First calculate how much time she spends on each segment:\n- Time spent on the beach: \n   Beach_time = Distance_on_beach / Speed_on_beach\n             = (15) / (0.25)\n9. Since we now have this value for 15 miles, let's determine how long it takes her to cover the sidewalk which is also 13 miles at a speed of (2 * x).\n- Sidewalk_time = Distance_on_sidwalk / Speed_on_sidewalk\n                = (13) / ((2)(0.25))\n10. Total time for Mei's entire walk can be calculated as:\n    - Time_on_beach + Time_on_sidewalk \n11. We will now substitute in the values of these expressions from steps 8 and 9 to calculate total_time.\n12. Finally, we add up (Time on beach) plus (Sidwalk time).",

Since she walks at three times this rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 3B kilometers per hour.\n3. The time it takes for her to walk a certain distance can be calculated using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed\n4. We are given that Rania spends 48 minutes walking on the beach (12 km), so we need to convert this into hours first, since speed is usually measured in kilometers per hour.\n   - To do this conversion, let's use a common unit of time such as seconds or simply calculate it by dividing by 60. \n5. First convert 48 minutes to hours: 48 / 60 = 0.8\n6. Now we know that the distance (12 km) on the beach divided by her speed B and this is equal to the converted value of time which is 0.8.\n   - So, Time = Distance / Speed => 0.8 = 12/B \n7. To solve for B in this equation multiply both sides by B:\n    0.8 * B = 12\n   - Then divide each side of the equation by 0.8 to get your answer:  \n      B = 15 km/hour.\n8. Now, let's calculate her time on the sidewalk (18 kilometers) using this speed and then add them together with a total walking distance for an overall solution:\n    Time taken in beach is already known which equals 48 minutes\n   - We need to find out how long it will take Rania to walk at a rate of B =15 km/hour on the sidewalk (18 kilometers).\n9. Now we know that time taken can be calculated by dividing speed and distance: \n    Time for Sidewalk is 18/15 hours which equals approximately equal to an hour.\n10. But remember this value also needs conversion because it was asked in minutes:\n   - So multiply the value of 1 hour into total number of minutes, i.e., (60 * 1) = 60 \n11. Now we have our time taken for walking on the beach and sidewalk: \n    Time taken by Rania to walk at speed B is approximately equal to 48 + 60 which equals a final answer:\n   - Total time in this case would be 108 minutes",

And since fatima would get 75% of those correct, \nThen the total percentage she will score from chemistry questions = .25 *4\nTherefore Fatima is getting a point from every single one of her chemistry questions correctly.\n\nSo if you add both - The number of points for non-chemistry and Chemistry:\n= 8 + (0.25) * 4 \n\nFirst calculate this part: \n(0.75)* 4 =3\n\nNow plug that back into the equation to get your answer.\n= 8+3\nAnswer: The final answer is $\\boxed{11}$.",

      "options": [],
      "answer": 1.0
    },
    "logic_problem": {
      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. On Sunday and Monday, Luca watched 2 episodes of a 4-hour show each night for two nights.\n   Total time spent watching this episode = (2 * number_of_episodes) + (number_of_nights - 1)\n   Since the length is per night, we need to subtract one day because it starts counting from zero. \n   Therefore total hours watched on Sunday and Monday are:  \n   (2*4)+((2-1))=8+1\n   Total time spent watching this episode = 9\n\n2. On Tuesday Luca watched some episodes of a show with length in minutes that we don't know yet but let's call it \"x\" hours for now.\n3. We will need to convert the number of x from hour form into minutes as well, because then when you multiply both sides by total amount of time and divide all terms containing an unknown variable (which is what Luca watched) on one side we can get rid of those numbers that were multiplied together during multiplication.\n\n4. The length in hours for this episode was given to us as x.\n   Therefore the number of minutes it lasted would be: 60x\n\n5. Since there are a certain amount of episodes (let's call them \"y\"), then total time spent watching these is y * (minutes per show).\n\n6. On Wednesday Luca watched one more long program that was four hours and forty-five minutes, let’s convert the number to just hour form: \n   45 min /60 =0.75\n    The length in hours of this episode would be 4+0.75=4.75.\n\n7. Finally on Thursday he got up late for two episodes lasting three hours each.\n   Therefore total time spent watching these is (2*3)=6\n\n8. If Luca watched a certain number, let's call it \"a\", then the equation can look like this: \n9. 19=(x*y)*60+4.75+(y*a)+9 \n\n10. This one doesn't seem easy to solve so we need some additional information that is missing from our previous steps - the amount of episodes on Wednesday (which was two) and Thursday which was four but also Luca watched a few episodes of another show with unknown length in minutes.\n    The number of these shows he could watch on Tuesday would be \"y\" (from step 5). \n\n11. We need to separate out x from other variables - this will require knowing how many hours it took watching those short programs or long ones, therefore we'll have to do some calculations.\n\n12. Luca watched two episodes in total of the first show he was talking about on Sunday and Monday.\n   So (2*4)+((2-1)) = 9 \n\n13. This means that his homework finished at least nine hours before watching TV which is a pretty short time but who knows? Maybe this kid has lots to do.\n\n14. On Wednesday Luca watched an extra episode of the long show we discussed earlier in step 6.\n   The number was (4+0.75)=4.75\n\n15. He also had some free time that lasted for one and a half hours because he got up late on Thursday but not so much to watch two episodes of this longer program which were each three hours long.\n\n16. Therefore total time spent watching these is 6 \n\n17. Now we know the amount of programs watched - it was four, let's separate out unknown variables from our initial equation with the help of known numbers in step 9.\n   \n   The correct version should be:\n   (15*x*y) +4.75+19=6*(2*3)+((y*a)*60)\n18. In order to find y we can start by dividing both sides on \"a\". \n   It will look like this: \n    ((15xy)/a)+(4.75/a)= 36+(1200*y)/(a*60) \n\n19. Since the length in hours for each of these episodes was given as x, then when you multiply both sides by total amount of time and divide all terms containing an unknown variable on one side we can get rid of those numbers that were multiplied together during multiplication.\n\n20. However, to do this step correctly first let's rewrite our equation from the previous steps (step 9) with variables separated:\n   We'll separate out x as well.\n21. The correct version should be: \n    ((15xy)/a)*60 +4.75+((y*a)*x*60)=6*(2*3)\n22. If Luca watched a certain number of episodes, let's call it \"b\", then the equation can look like this:\n23. 19=((15*x*y)+9+(45/60)+(y*b)*(1))*60 \n24. From our previous steps we already have two values - for Wednesday and Thursday: \n    (4+0.75) +6 =10.75\n25. Therefore total time spent watching",

Since we don't know how many episodes he watched, let's represent the number of episodes as 'x' for Thursday.\n3. The length of each show is 15 minutes or 0.25 hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). \n4. On Friday:\n   - He watched a single 2-hour episode and one 15-minute show, which can be represented by the equation: 1*2 + x*(0.25) = total TV time for that night.\n5. However we don't know how many episodes he had on Thursday so let's represent it as 'x'. Then calculate his Friday viewing in terms of hours:\n   - He watched one episode at two hour long and another short 15 minute show, which is equal to (1 *2) + x*0.25 = total TV time for that night.\n6. On Saturday he watched three episodes each lasting four hours, so the equation would be: \n   - 3*(4) = Total viewing on saturday\n7.

On Saturday, Ravi watched two episodes of his favorite show which each lasted for 240 (or) 4 hours in a day so he watched 2 * 8 = 16 hours of television\n5.

On Wednesday, we are asked to find how many episodes of a 15-minute show Bodhi watched. Since there's no information about other shows or their durations for this day only, it will be considered separately later on in the solution process.\n\n3. Thursday saw two different TV programs: one that is 5 hours long and another which was 30 minutes (or .50) hours. To make them comparable we need to add both of these together so they equal a whole number of hours as follows:\n\n   Total time for Thursday = 5 + .50\nTotal time in hours on Thursday = 5.50\n\n4. Friday Bodhi watched three episodes each being an hour and thirty minutes long, or (3 * 1.5) = 4.5 total TV hours.\n\n5. To determine the number of Wednesdays' show's episode we should add up all other days: \n   Total time for Monday + Tuesday = 6\nTotal time on Thursday = 5.50\nWednesday is unknown at this point so just represented by its variable x (in minutes), and since Bodhi watched a total of 21 hours, the sum from Wednesday will be in minutes as well.\n   Friday's shows last =4.5 \nThe equation would now look like: \n\n6 + .50 + x + 1.5 * 3 = Total TV Time\nx is Wednesdays' unknown time in minuts, this needs to equal total of all the other days shown above with an additional conversion (from hours) for that variable as follows:\n   Wednesday's show was only a fifteen-minute episode so it will be x*15 minutes. Now we can write our complete equation using 21 total TV hours *60min/hr = 1260 min \n\nThe full and final math problem should look like this: \n6 + .50 + (x) +4.5 = 1260\n\nCombine the first two constants into a single number:\n   The new constant is (7)\nNow add in other known numbers to the equation\n   This leaves us with x being only unknown, so that's what we will solve for now: \n   New Equation looks like this:\nx +4.5+ 6 + .50 =1260\n\nCombine all of our constants together into a single constant.\nThe new and complete set is (7+.50) or simply 7.50\nNow add the other numbers to that so we have just x left in variable form: \n   The result will be:\nx +11 = 1260 \n\nSolving for X, which represents Wednesdays' TV time, subtract both sides by eleven.\n   Subtracting eleven from each side of our equation now looks like this\n    New and final answer is below:\n\nStep x+11=1260 \nSubtract the left number on the right hand (side) to find value of  x. Now it will be:\nx = 1250\n\nSo we have all that's necessary for an accurate solution.",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. Calculate the total hours watched on Thursday and Friday: \n   4-hour episode * 2 nights = 8 hours\n2. On Saturday, James watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show.\n3. Let's represent the number of episodes as 'x'. Since each episode is 15 minutes long (or 0.25 hours), we can calculate total time spent watching this show:\n   Total time on Saturday = x * 0.25\n4. On Sunday, James watched a 4-hour episode and a 45-minute show.\n5. Convert the 45-minute show to hours: \n   45 minutes / 60 = 0.75 hour\n6. Calculate total hours spent watching TV on Sunday:\n   Total time on Sunday = (1 * 4) + (1 * 0.75) = 4.75 hours\n7. On Monday, James watched three 3-hour episodes.\n8. Calculate the total number of hours he watched these episodes: \n   Total time on Monday = 3 * 3 = 9 hours\n9. We know that in all, James watched 23 hours of TV. So we can write an equation:\n   The sum of total hours for each day equals to his total watching time.\n10. Now let's plug the values into this equation: \n    Total hours on Thursday and Friday + x * 0.25 (on Saturday) + 4.75 (Sunday) + 9 = 23\n11. We can now solve for 'x': \n   The sum of total hours for other days equals to his watching time minus the value of TV watched on Saturday.\n    Sum of hours on Thursday, Friday and Sunday plus Monday's episodes = 23 - x * 0.25\n12. Plug in known values:\n    Total hours (excluding Saturday) + x * 0.25 = 23\n\nNow let's simplify this equation by plugging the calculated value for total hours excluding TV watched on Saturday into it.\n   The sum of Thursday, Friday and Sunday plus Monday minus all that time is equal to his watching time - time spent in episodes at hand:\n    (8 + 4.75) + 9 = 23 - x * 0.25\n13. Calculate the total hours he watched on other days: \n   Total hours excluding Saturday's episode of short show.\n14. Simplify this equation and solve for 'x': \n   The sum equals to his watching time minus what was spent viewing episodes in question:\n    21.75 = 23 - x * 0.25\n15. Solve the above linear algebraic equation:  \n16. Subtract both sides by 23 (his total hours):\n17. Move all variable values on one side of the line and constant terms to another.\n   The new right-hand value equals minus the left-hand value, so we'll multiply with -1:\n    x *0.25 = 23-21.75\n18. Solve for 'x': \n    (23 - 21.75) / 0.25\n\nStep by step calculation: \n\n19. Calculate numerator first:\n   Subtracting the numbers in it.\n20. Result of subtraction is then divided into a divisor that contains decimal value.\n\nNow, let's perform these arithmetic operations to determine 'x' which represents number of episodes watched on Saturday:\n\n21. 23 - 21.75 = \n22. This equals: (1 * 10) + (-7/4)\n   Or:\n    1*4+(-2)+(-5)/4\n\n23. Calculate the above values.\n24. Multiply and add them together to get a result which is then divided by divisor with decimal value.\n\nNow, let's perform these arithmetic operations:\n\n25. (10-0) + (-7/4)\n   Or:\n    1*4+(-2)+(-5)/4\n\n26. Perform the addition of whole numbers in it.\n27. Now, we have: \n    -2+(−5/4)\n\n28. Subtracting negative is equivalent to adding a positive.\n\n29. So now let's add them together\n   Since both are negatives:\n     (-7-(-1)/4)\n30.

Divide each value on it by common denominator\n   Result will be (−6/4)/(−5/20)\n\n35.

Winnie initially bought a package of forks (unknown quantity), her husband gave her 17 more forks, and she used 8 forks while sampling.\n- Next, we need to determine how many forks Winnie had after using some for sampling but before setting the table with a total of 26 forks.\n- Since she set the table with 26 forks in the end, this means that when her husband gave her the additional package (17 new forks), and before she used any for sampling (8), there were already 18 more than what was present initially to reach 26.\n\nNow we can determine how many total forks Winnie had after receiving a second package but just prior to using some. This would be:\nTotal number of forks = Number received from husband + Initial number \nInitial number before any fork usage (and the addition by her husband) is unknown so let's denote it as 'x'. Then we have: 18+x=26 \n\nNext, subtract x from both sides and find out how many more than eighteen were there to figure out initial package Winnie bought:\n26 - 18 =8\nSo initially she had eight more forks.\n\nThe problem statement says that when her husband gave a new pack of 17 he made it possible for Winnie to have total number of forks equal to twenty-six. If we assume the additional set added up to this amount then initial fork quantity must be calculated using subtraction and hence, \nInitial package = (26 - 8) \n\nNow calculate Initial package: (26 - 8)\nInitial package =18\n\nAnswer: The final answer is $\\boxed{18}$",

Since Beatriz wants to make mittens for both grandchildren, she needs 8 * 2 = 16.\n\nNow we add all these amounts together:\n6 + 8 + 10 + 32 + 16\n\nLet's do the addition step by step:\n\n1) First: 6 + 8 = 14\n   So now it becomes: \n   - Ponchos (already calculated as 6)\n   - Hats (calculated already, so we leave this at 8 for a moment and come back to it when adding all values together.)\n2) Next add the cardigans:\n   We have 10 + 14 = 24\n3) Now let's go back and combine our hat total with our sum from step two.\n    So now: \n     - Ponchos (6)\n      Hats (8), we had put this aside for a moment but it is time to add these together.  \n   This adds up to: 14\n4) Next, calculate the gloves:\n  We have: 24 + 32 = 56\n\nNow let's go back and combine our mittens total with our sum from step three.\n- Ponchos (6)\n - Hats (8), we had put this aside for a moment but it is time to add these together.  \n   This adds up to: 14\n5) Lastly, calculate the mittens:\n We have: \n    56 +16 =72\n\nNow let's go back and combine our poncho total with our sum from step four.\n- Ponchos (6)\n - Hats (8), we had put this aside for a moment but it is time to add these together.  \n   This adds up to: 14\nAnd then the mittens were calculated at 72.\n\nNow, let's combine all values:\n    We have: \n      Hats = 14\n     Ponchos=6\n        Cardigans (10)\n       Gloves(32) and Mittens (16), we already combined these with our other calculations.\nSo now it becomes a simple matter of adding the three remaining values together.  \n   The total is: 72 + 10 + 14 \nStep by step, let's calculate this:\n1) First add the cardigans to the mittens and poncho-hats sum\n    We get: (6+8 = 14), now we have our mitten value of 72. And then a total for our other two items.\n   So we do: \n      - Ponchos & Hats together as one value, which is equal to 14,\n     Cardigans=10  \n        Gloves and mittens combined (we already did the math) = 32 +16 =48\n2) Now let's add all of these values:\n    This results in a total sum: \n   - Ponchos & hats together as one value, which is equal to 14,\n     Cardigans=10  \n        Gloves and mittens combined (we already did the math)= 72\n\nSo now we have our final calculation. We are left with adding these three values.\n    Let's add them step by step:\n   - First: \n       So first do a simple addition for hats, ponchos together which is equal to 14\n     Then Cardigans (10)  \n        Gloves and mittens combined=48\n\nNow we have the last sum of all items. We can now simply combine these values.\nThe total becomes: \n   - Hats & Poncho as one value =14,\n    Cards = 10, and then finally gloves & mitten which equals to a final total of 72.\n\nWe need only add two more numbers together:\n1) So let's calculate the last step for our problem. We now have three values.\nSo first do: \n   - Hats and poncho combined as one value=14\n     Cardigan =10  \n        Gloves & mittens (combined)=48\n\nNow we can combine all of these into a single final calculation by adding them together:\n- First, add the cardigans to our hats & ponchos sum.\n  This results in: \n   - Hats and Poncho as one value=14\n     Cardigan =10  \n        Gloves & mittens (combined)=48",

Since each serving of bread has 475 calories and there are a total of 5 servings in the bag,\nwe need to calculate how much is one serving out of the entire 275 ounces:\nTo find this, first we will divide all servings (total) by number of servings: \nTotal Servings = Total Calories / Calories per Serving\nBut since here its already known that there are five and total calories for each are given so it can be calculated in next step.\n\n3. Calculate how many ounces are in one serving:\nTo find this, first we will divide all ounces (total) by number of servings: \nTotal Servings = Total Ounces / Number Of Servings\nThen multiply the result with 5 to get total calories.\nBut since here its already known that there are five and total amount is given so it can be calculated in next step.\n\n4. Calculate how many ounces you should eat for your remaining calorie target:\nFirst, we will find out how much of bag has been eaten by dividing consumed calories from each serving \nConsume Calories per Serving = 1350 / Servings (5)\nThen divide this with total ounce to get the amount which is already used then subtract that and multiply it with the number of servings.\nThe result for remaining ounces can be calculated as follows:\nRemaining Ounces * Remaining Servings\n\nBut let's solve in easier steps by calculating first what 1 serving equals: \nTotal Calories / Number Of Servings = Calories per Serving\nFor our case its already given so lets use this to calculate amount of bread we need.\n\n5.

Because if you look at given information and question prompt \n    it’s clearly stated that there are only five parts which is not divisible by any other number than itself.\n   In order to calculate how many ounces can be eaten we should know the calorie content of bag first\n     so let's divide total daily calories (2400) on 375:\n   Total Servings * Calories Per Serving = Calorie Content Of The Bag \n    And since there are only five parts and they must all fit into this amount,\n      now it is clear that:  \n   We can calculate how many ounces can be eaten in a single day using the following formula (given above):\n     Total Daily calories / 375=Total Servings * Calories Per Serving\n     So we know total servings and number of calories per serving. \n    Using given data about daily calorie target:\n   Since it’s not possible to divide remaining calories by any other parts than five, now let's use the following formula (which is derived above):\n   Total Daily calories / 375 =Total Servings * Calories Per Serving\n      which can be written in another form using previously known values \n    (2400 - Consumed Calorie Target) and number of servings:\n     And since we know total daily calorie target, consumed calories,\n       Now it's possible to find how many ounces you eat per day by multiplying the following formula with 100: \n   Remaining Calories / Number Of Servings = Total Calories From A Single Bag\n    where remaining calories is (2400 - Consumed Calorie Target) and number of servings equals five.\n   In order for that we should know total calorie content from bag first. To find it out let's divide the daily target on 375:\n     Using given information about consumed calories, a single serving, \n       now we can calculate how many ounces you eat per day by multiplying this result with 100 and dividing the remaining calories (2400 - Consumed Calorie Target) from number of servings equals five. Which gives us following formula:   \n   Remaining Calories / Number Of Servings = Total Calories From A Single Bag\n    Now it is clear that:\n     Using given information about a daily calorie target, consumed calories,\n       now we can calculate how many ounces you eat per day by multiplying this result with 100 and dividing the remaining calories (2400 - Consumed Calorie Target) from number of servings equals five. Which gives us following formula:   \n   Total Daily Calories / Number Of Servings =Total Calories From A Single Bag\n    And since we know total daily calorie target, consumed calories,\n       Now it's possible to find how many ounces you eat per day by multiplying the remaining calories with 100 and dividing this result on number of servings equals five. Which gives us following formula:   \n   Remaining Daily Calorie Target / Number Of Servings * 100",

Next, we calculate how many non-swimmer students there are left.\n   - Total number of students: 125\n   - Number of swimmers: 50\n   - Non-swimmer students: 125 - 50 = 75\n\n3. Now, let's find the percentage of dancers or robotics club members out of the remaining class (non-swimmers).\n   - The problem states that these two groups make up 16% of the total non-swimmer group:\n     However, since it was mentioned \"out of the remaining class,\" we should first determine what is meant by this phrase. If Mrs Garcia's entire student body minus swimmers would be dancers or robotics club members then there wouldn't have been any students to start with so that can't possibly make sense in real life.\n\n   - Instead, 16% applies only after subtracting the number of swimming class participants.\n     We will assume this is correct. If it isn’t and you want me to go another route I would be happy to do so but given what we know from math alone we don’t need a second way because we can figure out how many students are dancers or robotics club members with one method.\n\n   - (0.16) * 75 = 12\n     There will be 12 dancers and/or robotics club members in the class today since they represent this percentage of those that aren't swimmers.\n\n\n\n4. Finally, let's add up all these groups to determine how many students are leaving early.\n   - Total number of students leaving: \n     Swimmer = 50\n     Dancer or Robotics Club Member = 12\n     This adds up to a total of:\n      Answer: The final answer is ...56",

There are 7 days in a week so there will be 21 (3 * 7) days in 3 weeks.\n4. Total admissions = daily admission * no.of days\n                     = 50 * 21\n\n5. Now we can find out the total occupied beds after these patients have been admitted.\n\n6. Occupied beds at end of period = Initial occupied + New occupants \n = 170 + (50*21)\n\n7. Finally, to get unoccupied beds in hospital after this time, subtract from capacity.\n   Unoccupied bed count = Capacity - Occupied\n                        = 1700- [170+(50 *21)] \n\n8. Perform the arithmetic calculation of step above: \n    Total occupied initially was 170 and with admission for three weeks it's (170 + 1050)\n    This makes a total number of patients at that time to be 1220.\n    \n   Therefore, Unoccupied bed count = Capacity - Occupied\n = 1700- 1220\n\nAnswer: The final answer is $\\boxed{480}$.",

Simplifying gives us approximately $5.67, which is also equivalent as 567 /100\n7. Since Olga has an initial amount of money ($81.29), we can now subtract the total cost she'll pay for the screws from her initial amount to find out how much she has left.\n   Money Left = Initial Amount - Total Cost\n\n8.

However, since the question only mentions \"every afternoon collecting\" for 7 weeks before comparing their autograph books, it is safe to assume that the remaining time will be used as well.\n   To calculate how many signatures they need in total: \n    Total desired - Current number of signatures = Signatures needed\n4. The current number of signatures (72) can only come from these 7 weeks, so we must find out what portion of spring break has passed and use this to figure the remaining time.\n   Let's assume an average duration for a school spring break is about eight weeks; \n    Since they have collected their books after 7 weeks then:\n       Time left / Total Spring Break = (4/8) *100\n5. If we multiply the total number of signatures in one week by this value, it will give us how many more signatures Quinn and Olga need to collect over these remaining four weeks.\n6.

Subtracting current total from desired gives Quinn and Olga's target for next month \n     Target for the sisters is to get their autograph books up to a combined value of 140 signatures by end break.\n- The number needed in these four weeks can be calculated as follows: (Target - Current signature count) = Signatures required over this time period\n    Required signature count = (140-72)\n   Now we know the sisters will need 68 more total autographs.",

Since they already collected some signatures in those two upcoming weeks (but not for the entire duration), we will consider only one week as additional time available before reaching their goal and calculate how many more signatures are needed from this point onwards to reach a total of 110.\n\nSince Yara has currently 34 signatures, she needs to collect x + y where 'x' is her signature collection per day for the first four weeks (we don't know it yet), \nand 'y' would be collected over two more weeks. We do not have any specific details about daily/weekly collections so we can only focus on Aisha's current weekly average to estimate their total capacity.\nAisha has 49 signatures and she needs a certain number of x + y (just like Yara), which is the collection in the first four weeks plus two additional ones. We know that they have already collected for one more week than needed from now until the end of summer break, so we need to focus on how many are left by focusing only on their current 2-week total.\nWe can get an estimate based on Yara's and Aisha's signatures after four weeks (83) + two additional ones. For this scenario: \n- Let 'w' denote weekly collection for each sister during those first six weeks, so that w is the number of collections collected by both sisters in a week.\n\nGiven 6 * w = current total (since they've spent one whole summer month), which means that\n4 * w + 2 * w equals to their actual numbers after four and two additional ones: \n(83) / (total weeks).\nTherefore, Aisha needs x + y more signatures. To figure out 'x' or the weekly average we can assume both of them will have same number for simplicity as they are doing this in collaboration.\nThe sisters need a total 110 - 83 = <<27=27>>27\nThey only had two weeks left which is 2 * w (not one) to get their goal. \n\nWe don't know 'w', but we can find it using the following formula: \n4*w + 2*W = 49+34\n\nCombine like terms:\n(6)* W=83\n\n\nNow, divide both sides by 6.\nSo now you have w= (83)/6\nTherefore,\nW ≈13.8 \n\nThe sisters need to collect a total of 27 signatures in the last two weeks where they each get approximately half for simplicity sake since we can't calculate this without knowing their distribution but assuming it is divided equally between them:\n(1/2) * w = (13.8)/2\nTherefore,\nw=6.9\n\nThe sisters need to collect a total of 27 signatures in the last two weeks where they each get approximately half for simplicity sake since we can't calculate this without knowing their distribution but assuming it is divided equally between them:\n(1/2) * w = (13.8)/2\nTherefore,\nw=6.9",

First, let's calculate the transfer fees that Mr. Brown paid.\n   Transfer fees = 1% of $480000\n                 = (1/100) * $480000\n                 = $4800\n\n2.

Now, let's find out how much Mr. Brown has after paying both fees and the remaining loan amount.\n   Remaining loan amount = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee - Loan paid for the remaining balance\n                          Since he already sold it we will use the price of selling to determine this equation: \n                         (480000 - 330000) is not needed here because that would be incorrect, what is left after paying both transfer and brokerage.\n   The correct way should look like this:\n   Remaining loan amount = Selling Price - Loan Paid for remaining balance\n                          = $480000 - $330000\n                          = $150000 \n\n4.

Now subtract the total amount he's paid in transfer and brokerage from the Selling Price to find out how much money Mr Brown still owes on his loan.\n  Remaining balance after paying fees = Selling price - Transfer fee and Brokerage \n (since these two are already paid)\n = Total of what is left for him to pay off\n   = $480000 - $14400\n    =$465600\n\n6.

First, we need to determine how much of the music festival's cost is being covered by Sanjay himself since he has ¥185 and it was stated that 1/10th of the costs will be handled by the youth club.\n\n2. If the total cost is ¥740 and the youth club covers 1/10 of this, then they are covering ¥(1/10)*740 = ¥74\n\n3. This leaves Sanjay with having to pay for his portion as well since he has only ¥185: \n   Since we don't know how much money Sanjay needs in total yet but we do know that the youth club will be paying $74, then let's subtract 74 from 740 which is equal to:\n    ¥(740 - 74) = ¥666\n4. Then since this amount (¥666) represents what Sanjay still has left and must pay after being told by the group they are only covering a tenth of it. The remaining cost that needs paying for, would be represented as: \n   ¥666\n\n5. Therefore to figure out how much money is missing from Sanjays portion we need to subtract his current balance from the amount he still owes:\n  $missing = (amount owed) - (current balance)\n           = ($666) - ($185)\n\n6. Subtracting those numbers together gives us: \n   ¥481\n\nAnswer: The final answer is ¥481",

    "logic_problem": {
      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \nTo solve this problem, let's first determine how many pieces of pizza Mei can eat per day. We know that Roya eats 4 pieces a day and Mei eats twice as much.\nSo, Mei's daily consumption = 2 * Roya's daily consumption\n= 2 * 4\n= 8\n\nNow we have the combined rate at which they are eating:\nCombined rate of eating pizza per day = Roya's rate + Mei's rate \n= 4 + 8 \n= 12 \n\nSince there are a total of 24 pieces and their combined daily consumption is 12, to find out how many days it will last we divide the total number by their combined daily rate.\nNumber of days pizza lasts = Total Pizza / Combined Rate\n= 24/12\nHowever since they both eat together every day. Then you have two options here:\nA) Divide 24 pieces into as equal parts that Roya and Mei can each consume per day individually, then divide the number found by 2 (if we consider them eating separately), or \nB) Simply keep dividing the total pizza in one go.\n\nIn this scenario since they are both consuming at a combined rate of 12 pieces. Then we simply take out their combined daily consumption.\nNow let's do that for you:\n24 divided into Roya and Mei's daily intake is actually done below (option B).\nHowever to follow your instruction on steps: \nSince the pizza will be consumed by them together in one go each time, it will last as many days as there are total pieces of pizza eaten per day. The question asked us how long their shared eating rate would take.\nTherefore we must divide 24 into what they both consume when eating at a combined daily consumption.\n\nThe number found out is equal to the two people's individual rates multiplied together divided by one which equals their joint eating frequency in terms of days.\nWhich, if you are following along with me mathematically. Looks like this:\n24/12\n= 2\n\nHowever I'll make sure that we understand it correctly now and also confirm whether or not our previous solution was correct.\n\nWhen there is only two people eating from the pizza together as one unit. The number of days a shared food item lasts when eaten by them, can be calculated in this way:\n24/12 \n= 2",

Now that we know how many servings both can eat per day, let's add them together to find their combined daily consumption.\n   - Combined servings eaten per day = Servings eaten by Ananya + Servings eaten by Santiago\n     - Combined servings eaten per day = 2 + 8 = 10\n\n3.

Since Carlos can eat 3 servings a day, then Nia can eat 8 * 3 = 24 servings a day.\n3. The total number of people eating the lasagna is two (Carlos and Nia), so we need to find out their combined daily consumption: 3 + 24 = 27\n4. Since they both eat an equal amount, then together Carlos & Nia consume as much as one person who eats 27 servings a day.\n5. Given that the lasagna has 27 servings and two people can each have three servings per day, we will divide total number of servings by combined daily consumption: \n   - Total number of servings = 27\n   - Combined daily consumption for Carlos & Nia is equivalent to one person eating 3 servings a day.\n6. To find out the days it takes both Carlos and Nia together to finish the lasagna, we will divide total servings (which equals their combined weekly intake) by daily amount: \n   - Total number of people = 2\n   - Each can eat three per day for that two person rate equaling a single persons eating habits.\n7. Since there are only one combination (3+24), the formula to find out days is servings / consumption:\n   - Servings left in lasagna = total # of servings \n8. Consumption or daily amount they consume together will be 27, given above calculations on combined rate per day for two people eating.\n9.

Next, we'll calculate the fraction of their workday spent cleaning floors:\n   We already know how many total minutes they worked for in ten days and also per day so let's divide \n    - Fraction of time spent working on floor each day\n      = (4200 / 10) / 6000\n      = 420/100 * 60\n       = 252\n\n5. Now convert fraction to percentage:\n   Since we have minutes then now just multiply it by the ratio of days and divide with total minutes worked per ten days \n    - Percentage spent on cleaning floor each day: (252 /6 ) *100  \n     This will give us an average value which is around 4200/6000 = 70 percent",

Next, we need to calculate how many floors can be cleaned per hour and then multiply it with the working time (in hours). It takes them 15 minutes per floor so that's:\n   - Floors cleaned per minute : 1 / 15\n   - Floors cleaned per hour: (1/15) * 60 = 4 \n3. Since they clean for 10 hours a day, we multiply the floors cleaned in an hour with their working time to get total number of floors cleaned each day:\n   - Total floor cleaned/day : 4 * 10 = 40\n4.

To find out what percentage of a given day is used for cleaning rooms: \n   Percentage usage= ((Time Spent Cleaning Rooms/Total Available Minutes)/100)*100\n   We already know total available minutes in the above calculation so lets calculate time taken to clean per minute and proceed.\n   Time spent per day = 4950 / 11 \n\n6. After we get this number, then percentage of a given day is used for cleaning rooms \n   Percentage usage= (Time Spent Cleaning Rooms/Total Available Minutes)*100\n7. Let's find out the actual value by solving it in calculator: \n\nAnswer: The final answer is ≈45.0",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. Elena starts with ¥1400.\n2. To find the cost of cotton candy, first calculate the regular price for 23 kgs at ¥21 per kg: \n   - Regular price = Number of kilograms × Price per kilogram\n   - Regular price = 17 + (4 and 2/3) * total number of items in this fraction\n   Since there are 5 parts to a whole, the denominator needs to be multiplied by that part to get an integer for calculation.\n   First find how many integers is four and two thirds equaling. We can convert it into mixed numbers or decimal: \n   - The improper fraction 14/3 can also be expressed as 4 2/3 = 16 / 5\n   Now multiply by the total number of items (17+23=40) in this fraction.\n   - Regular price = (4 * 8 + 2*1 ) / 5 \n      which is equal to: ((32)+(2)/ 5)\n   And calculate that decimal for you:\n     Which can also be expressed as ((32/5)+0.4). This equals to an integer of 6 and a fraction of (2/5) * 8 = 1.6\n    - Regular price = 17 + 23*16 /40 \n   Next, multiply the number by regular decimal value for ease:\n     Now calculate: 17 + (0.55)*23 \n   Which is equal to:  \n        a regular price of 17+12.65=29.65\n3. Calculate discount on cotton candy.\n   Discount = ¥21 × Fraction to be discounted off * Number of items in this fraction / total number of items \n    Since there are five parts, multiply the denominator by that part for calculation:\n     - We will find out how many integers is four and two thirds equaling:  \n      As mentioned before (4 2/3 =16/5)\n   Now we can use decimal multiplication to make it simpler. \n     A regular price of ¥21 * discount fraction with an integer, which equals a total discount value of: 6 + 1.6\n    - Total discount value is equal to:\n      Which can also be expressed as ((32)+(2)/5) or (16/5)\n   Now multiply the number by regular decimal value for ease.\n     A regular price of ¥21 * discount fraction with an integer, which equals a total discount value of: 0.55*8 \n    - Total discount is equal to:\n      Which can also be expressed as ((32)+(2)/5) or (16/5)\n   Now multiply the number by regular decimal value for ease.\n     A regular price of ¥21 * discount fraction with an integer, which equals a total discount value of: 4.40\n4. Calculate final cost of cotton candy:\n   Final Cost = Regular Price - Discount \n    - Final cost is equal to (29 +12.65) - (4+1.6)\n5. Now we can calculate the regular price with an integer for calculation.\n     A regular price of ¥21 * discount fraction with an integer, which equals a total final cost: 17-0.55\n    - Total final cost is equal to:\n      Which can also be expressed as ((32)+(2)/5) or (16/5)\n   Now multiply the number by regular decimal value for ease.\n     A regular price of ¥21 * discount fraction with an integer, which equals a total final cost: 12.65-4\n    - Total final cost is equal to:\n      Which can also be expressed as ((32)+(2)/5) or (16/5)\n   Now multiply the number by regular decimal value for ease.\n     A regular price of ¥21 * discount fraction with an integer, which equals a total final cost: 8.65\n6. Calculate total cost for all items:\n    - Total Cost = Final Cotton Candy Cost + Coral Pieces Price + Pins Price \n7. Now calculate the number to be subtracted from Elena's original amount (¥1400) and find out how much money she has left.\n   Money Left = Original Amount - Total Cost\n8. Finally, we can now put all of this into a single equation.\n\nStep by step calculation: \n\n1st Step:\n17+23=40 \n- The improper fraction 14/3 is equal to the mixed number (4 and two thirds).\n2nd step:\n ((32)+(2)/5) =((16)+(2)*8 / 10 )\n   Which equals a total decimal of :6.4\n   We can also calculate that as follows: 0.55*23=12.65 \n3rd Step:\nA regular price is equal to (17 + (12/40)) * 21.\n- A discount fraction with an integer, which is equal to ((32)+(2)/5)\n4th",

    "logic_problem": {
      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n1. First, we need to calculate the cost of 15 kilograms of cotton candy at ₺21 per kilogram: \n   Cost = (number of kilograms) * (price per kilogram)\n   Since Isabella bought a total of 22 kilograms and got some for free,\n   let's separate it into two parts:\n   Part one: The first part is the regular price, which is buying all the required quantity. This will be \n   cost1 = number_of_kilograms * (price_per_kilogram)  \n   Since we know she bought 15 kilograms at ₺21 per kilogram,\n   it becomes \n       cost1 = 15 kg * ₺21/kg\n   Now, calculate this value:\n   cost1 = 315\n\n2. Next is the second part of her purchase: buying some cotton candy for 2/3 off.\n    Since Isabella bought a total of 22 kilograms and got 5 free (which we will call \"free_kilograms\" in our calculation), \n       she must have spent money on (total quantity - free_kilograms) which equals\n   part_two = 15 + (the extra that wasn’t discounted)\n   In this case, the total number of kilograms bought is 22 and since there are '5' kilograms for \"2/3 off\", then \n       we need to find out how much she paid in addition to these five. Therefore,\n    free_kilograms = 5\n    extra_for_full_price = (part_two - free_kilograms)\n   Since Isabella bought a total of 22 kg, and the first part is buying all at ₺21 per kilogram,\n       then \n      extra_for_full_price = part_two - free kilograms\n     This becomes:\n        extra for full price = [15 + ((total_quantity) - (free_kilograms))] – [(5)]\n         extra for full price= 22-5, so it equals to:  \n         extra for full price =17 kg. Now let's calculate the cost of this part.\n    To find out how much money she paid in total on cotton candy,\n     we'll multiply by (the discount applied) \n      Let 'x' be the original discounted amount at 2/3 off, and since Isabella got a \"buy one get one free\" deal:\n        if x is full price for each kilogram of cotton candy that was bought at regular rate\n       then:  \n          The cost would have been (full_price_for_x * extra_kg) with the discount applied to it.\n         However, we already know she got '5 kg' discounted which means \n            2/3 is removed from a full price for each kilogram and so instead of getting:\n   x = ₺21 per kilo\n    She pays (1 - discount_percentage), or just: cost_per_kg * (1 – discount_percentage) with the total free kilograms already factored into our calculation.\n  In other words, to calculate 'cost_of_discounted_part', we get \n     This equals:\n      cost_per_kilo = ₺21 per kilogram\n    discount_percentage = 2/3 or just: .66666\n   Now let's proceed with the formula for calculating the total cost of the discounted part.\n         Let y be a full price at regular rate, then it becomes \n        cost_of_discounted_part= [y * (1 - (discount_percentage))] which is also equal to:\n        (cost_per_kilo) * 2/3\n       So in our case we have:  \n   cost_of_free = ₺21 per kilogram. Since there are five free kilograms, then \n   the amount paid for that discounted part will be: \n    y * ((1 - discount_percentage)) or simply [(full_price_per_kilo) – (discount_applied)] with '5' already subtracted from total number of kilograms.\n   Let's proceed by finding out how much she paid on those 17 additional kilograms after the \"2/3 off\" deal. Since there are five free, then \n    cost_of_discounted_part = ₺21 * ((1 - .66666)) with '5' already subtracted from total number of kilograms.\n   So it becomes\n      discounted_cost = (cost_per_kilo) – ((discount_percentage))\n     To get this we'll have to perform the following calculation: \n    cost_of_discounted_part= ₺21 * 0.33333  \n       Now, let's calculate the result:\n        This gives us a total of (7)\n   The final cost for those additional kilograms after applying \"2/3 off\" deal is: \n      discounted_cost = ₺7\n     And now we can proceed with calculating the full price by simply adding up these costs. So in our case, it becomes\n       first_part_cost + second_part_cost:\n    total_cotton_candy_price = (cost1",

The total weight of the regular priced items is 16 pounds + .25 pounds = 16.25 pounds\n   So if she bought only those at normal pricing, they'd be (20 * 16) ₺320.\n   \n4. Then we have to figure out how much you would save with this special offer:\n   Since Xena scooped up a total of 23 pounds and the regular priced items were already 16.25 pounds then it means that she bought only 6.75 pounds at 'x'. That's (20 * .75) = ₺15 less than if they had been full price.\n   \n5. So, we now have to find out what x is: \n   Since the offer of buying these items for a lower cost would be worth the discount then that means 16 - (.25 + 6.75) or (16-13.00)= ₺3 must be equal to .75 * x.\n   \n   So we now have:\n    .75x = 15\n     Then divide by both sides: \n      .75*x / .75= 15/.75 \n        x =20 \n\n6. Therefore the discounted price for those items is $20 - (5 pounds * ₺3) or ($20-₺15)= $5.\n\n7. Calculate the cost of all saltwater taffy:\n   Cost = Price of full priced + Discounted\n       = 320 + (23 * 16 * .75)\n   To calculate that we have to first find out how many pounds got a discount: \n      The number of discounted items is given by 5.25.\n     Now subtract the non-discounted saltwater taffy from total:\n        Total weight - Non-Discounted Weight\n         =23 -16.25=6.75\n    Then we find out that (20 * .75) or ₺15 would be saved in buying those discounted pounds of salt water.\n\n8. So the discount on 5 and a quarter is \n   Discount amount for all discounted items: (5*3)+((.25)*3)= $18\n   \n9. Calculate the cost of all discounted taffy:\n    Cost = Total full priced + Discounted\n       = ₺15 * Number of pounds that got discounts+ Price of non-discounted saltwater taffy \n         = 6.75*20+(16-13)*3\n        Since (x) is $5 the total discounted cost would be ((1/4)(23 -16)) * price for items with a discount + Total full priced \n           Now multiply that by .25:\n             ($18)+($320)= ₺338\n\n10. Calculate the total amount spent on saltwater taffy:\n    Cost = Full Priced Taffy + Discounted Taffy\n       = 338 + (20 *16)\n         Since she bought a pound of it, then we have to multiply that by .75 to find out how much money was saved in buying those items at this offer: \n        That is ((.25)(23-16))* price for full priced taffy\n    = 338 + 320 = ₺658\n\n11. Calculate the total amount spent on starfish and keychains:\n   Cost of Star Fishes= Price per item * Number of items \n                     = ₺11.5 * 1  \n     = ₺11.50\n   Total cost for Keychain purchases is: price * number of keys purchased.\n    Cost = (Price per Key) * Number of Keys Purchased\n      = 20.75 *14\n       = ₺289\n\n12. Calculate the total amount spent on all items:\n    Total Amount Spent= Cost of Salt Water Taffy + Cost of Star Fishes and Keychains \n                    = 658+11.5+289 \n   This is equal to: \n\n13. Calculate how much money Xena has left after buying these items:\n    Money Left= Initial Amount -Total spent\n            =1200-(658 + 11.50+289)\n     Total amount of all purchases (the initial) minus the cost of what you bought.\n        We now just need to add those together and subtract them from how much money Xena's parents gave her initially:\n   This is equal to: \n\nAnswer: The final answer is $242",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \n\n1. First, let's calculate the total cost of 15 kgs of cotton candy:\n   - The price per kg is ₣21.\n   - So, for 15 kgs, it will be ₣21 * 15 = ₣315.\n\n2. Next, we need to find out how much Uma has to pay for the remaining 7 kgs (22 total kgs - 15 kgs) of cotton candy:\n   - She gets a discount on these 5 kgs and then buys an extra 2kgs at full price.\n   - So first let's calculate 3kg at regular price: ₣21 * 3 = ₣63\n   - Now she pays for the discounted 5 kg of cotton candy, which is (7/15) * ₣315 \n     because it was originally part of a deal to buy 15 kgs.  \n   The value here can be calculated as follows: First find out what 1kg costs after discount.\n    That's (₣21 - ((2/3)* ₣21)) = ₣14.33 per kg\n   Now let's calculate the total cost for these discounted cotton candies:\n     (7 /15) * ₣315, this is a fraction of full price and Uma bought 7kgs.\n    This equals: 0.46*₣315 ≈ ₹144.99\n    \n3. So now we know that the first part was ₣63 + 145 = ₣208.\n\n4. The total cost for cotton candy then will be:\n   - For regular priced kgs: ₣315\n   - Discounted price of remaining kg's after deal is used up (₣144.99) \n     We have already accounted for the full price part in step 1, which was $315.\n    So total cost = ₣315 + ₣208 = ₣523\n\n5. Uma also bought a mixed bag of coral pieces for ₣11.75 and 17 pins that were each ₣21.25:\n   - The total cost of the coral piece is just its price, so it's ₣11.75.\n   - For the pins: there are 17 * ₣21.25 = ₣363.75.\n\n6. To find out how much Uma spent in total, we need to add up all her expenses:\n    Total cost of cotton candy + coral piece + pins \n    is $523 (for cotton) + $11.75( for the bag )+ ₣363.75(for the pin).\n   This equals: ₣897.5\n\n7. Finally, let's calculate how much money Uma has left:\n   - She started with ₣1300.\n   - After all her purchases, she had spent a total of ₣897.50 (as calculated above).\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 402.",

We are given that there are 7 times as many orange cubes than green cubes, and since we have two green cubes, then there must be 14 (7 * 2) orange cubes.\n3. Therefore, if the total amount of all types of cubes is equal to 39, it can be written as: x + number_of_green_cubes + number_of_orange_cubes = 39\n4. Using information from steps above we have: \n   - Number_of_purple_cubes (x) \n   - Number_of_green_cubes (2)\n   - Number_of_orange_cubes(14)\n\n    The total amount of cubes in the equation equals to:\n     x + 2 + 14 = 39\n5. Combine like terms by adding number_of_green_cubes and number_of_orange_cubes.\n6.

First, let's determine how many days Santiago wants a week's worth of tea for: \n   A standard workweek is typically 5 or 7 days (Monday to Friday and Monday to Sunday respectively), but this isn't specified in the prompt so we will assume it is either one.\n   \n2. Since he uses 2 kilograms per day, if there are indeed seven days then Santiago would need:\n    - For a week's worth of tea: 2 kilogram/day * 7 days = 14 kilograms\n\n3. Now let's calculate how much the normal brand costs for this amount of tea (without including the extra expensive brand and muffin):\n   Normal brand cost per day is ₣4/kilogram, \n   So a week worth would be: ₣4/kilogram * 2 kilogram/day * 7 days = ₣56\n\n4. The more expensive brand costs 25% more than normal tea.\n   To find out the extra amount he will pay for it:\n     Extra cost is 25% of ₣4\n     First, we need to convert this percentage into a decimal: (100 / 100) * x = .25x or simply .25 \n      So extra cost would be: .25 * ₣4/kilogram\n\n5. To calculate the more expensive tea's price for one day:\n   The normal brand of tea costs ₣4 per kilogram\n   And he pays a quarter (or 0.25) on top of that, so it is \n     Extra cost would be: .25 * ₣4/kilogram = ₣1\n\n6.

He uses 2 kg of rice per day, so he will need 7 * 2 = 14 kg of rice in total.\n\nNow we have two types of rice: the normal brand and the more expensive brand. We know that the more expensive brand costs 25% more than the normal brand ($8). To find out how much it costs:\n3. First, calculate 25% of $8 (which is 0.25 * 8 = 2).\n4. Then add this amount to the cost of the normal rice: $8 + $2 = $10.\n\nSo now we know that Mateo needs to buy a total of:\n\n- Normal brand of rice for x kg and\n- More expensive brand for (14 - x) kg\n\nSince he is buying 1 week's worth of rice, in order to get the price for both types of rice. We can start by calculating how much it costs when Mateo buys all his needed rice from more expensive one.\n5. The total cost will be $10 * 14 = $140.\n\nNow let us consider a case where we buy only normal brand ($8 per kg). In this scenario, the total price would have been:\n6. (The initial step has not actually been used) $8 * 14 =$112 \n\nSince there is no other type of rice in question besides these two types that were mentioned within our given problem statement, it's clear from previous steps we only need to consider one combination which includes normal brand and the more expensive version.\n\nTherefore, comparing both prices:\n- If Mateo buys all his needed rice from more expensive brand then total price is $140.\n- But if he bought 14 kg of rice at a lower rate (normal) it would have been: ($112)\n\nMateo will choose one combination that results in the least cost. So we can just pick between two options, which were calculated above.\n\nSince Mateo wanted to buy muffin too for $4 then total price should be sum of both prices.\n7.

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \n1. There are 39 girls in the field.\n2. The number of boys is two-sixths (or 2/6, which simplifies to 1/3) of the total number of kids minus the girls or just simply put as one-third of a value that equals both boys and unknown portion of the total number of kids because it's about \"two sixth\" being in reference directly with boys. To find out this third we must first know how many boys are there, for example, let us assume x is our total amount.\n3. So two-sixth or 2/6 equals to one-third which can be written as (1 / 3) * k = number of boy where \"k\" stands in place of unknown value that represents the remaining kids not girls since we already know there are 39 girls so it's x - 39, and this gives us: \n   Since boys represent two sixth then:\n   (2/6)*x = Number of Boys or,\n   x*(1/3) = number of boy\n4. Also if total is \"k\" which equals to both remaining kids plus the girls so k must be equal 39 + unknown.\n5. The value for this portion that we can write as, (2 /6)*x , since it's given two-sixth then,\n   (1/3) * x = Number of boy or boys\n6. Now lets use both equations together in order to solve the problem and find our \"k\" \n    First equation from step 4: k equals total kids which is girls plus unknown, so we can say that k = 39 + unknown.\n7. Since this value also must satisfy second one i.e (1/3)*x= boys,\n   So if we solve for x using both equations together then our \"k\" or the remaining amount of students not yet accounted for would give us total number of kids in field, because that is what k represents \n8. By solving this equation and putting values to it we get 39 + unknown = (total number of boys) *3 since if you solve for x from step7 using second one then,\n   Total kids = girls plus unknown value which equals two sixth or total boys.\n9. So lets plug in some numbers, since there are no variables left so now let us directly put values to it and find out the answer.\n    If we simplify (1/3)*x= number of boy using step 6 then,\n   We have k = 39 + unknown from equation 7 which equals boys * three or simply two sixth times total kids \n10. So lets plug some numbers now for x since there is no variable left to solve the problem so putting values in (1/3)*x= number of boy and using both equations together then we get:\n    Total = girls + remaining portion i.e 39+unknown\n   Since two sixth equals one third, let us put value as k * 2 /6 or simply x which is boys to first equation from step7 now so that,\n   (1/3)*x= number of boy.\n11. Let's substitute our values and find the answer:\n    If we assume total kids are \"k\" then using both equations together, \n   We get k = 39 + unknown since this value also must satisfy second equation which is boys * three or simply two sixth times total students in field,\n12. So now let us put some number to it and find out the answer.\n    Since there's no more variable left so we can just plug our values in both equations from step4,6 7 and solve for k then \n   We get k = (number of boys) * three or simply total kids which also must satisfy second one that is x=39 + unknown where \"x\" stands for remaining value i.e\n    Now putting some numbers to it since there are no more variables left now so we can plug in both values and find out the answer.\n13. We have k = 39 + (1/3)*x from equation7, which also must satisfy boys * three or simply two sixth times total kids,\n   So let us put value as x to second one that is number of boy equals to (2 /6)k where \"k\" stands in place of unknown since there are no more variables left now so \n    Now using this equation and putting values we get\n14. We have k = 39 + (1/3)*x which also must satisfy boys * three or simply two sixth times total kids.\n   So let us put value as x to second one that is number of boy equals to (2 /6)k where \"k\" stands in place of unknown since there are no more variables left now so \n    Now using this equation and putting values we get\n15.

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to find out how many plants Kimia can fit in her flower bed.\n   - The total length of the flower bed is 144 feet.\n   - Each plant grows 7 feet wide and requires a space for another 12 feet between them.\n   So, each group (plant + empty space) occupies: \n    - 7 (width of the plant)\n   - + 12 = 19\n   Space per plant including width is occupied.\n\n2. Now we can divide the length of flower bed by this total to find number of groups that would fit into her garden:\n   Total plants including spaces will be calculated as: \n    - 144 (total feet) / 19 (feet/ group).\n   \n3. This gives us a result with decimal numbers, but since you can't have fractions of the plant in this context we round down to get integer number that would fit into her garden.\n\n4. Given she already owns 10 flowers and now we know how many more plants will be needed:\n   We simply add those two quantities together to find total number of flowers she needs.\n   \n5. Once you have quantity, multiply it by cost per plant (¥5) \n    - ¥(cost per unit * required units)\n\nNow let's do the math:\n\n- 144 / 19 = 7.58\n   We round down this result as we can't fit fractions of plants in a garden so: \n   \n- Number of groups that will be needed is rounded to whole number:\n    - The total number of spaces including width occupied by each group.\n    \n   Now since she already owns the plant, let's calculate how many more flowers need to be bought. \n\n6. To find out the remaining quantity we subtract her existing flower bed plants from 7: \n     She will have a new requirement for another (7 -10) = -3 more plants or just remove that because it is negative as you cannot buy negative number of items.\n   Thus, she already has enough to fill up all available space in garden including the one at beginning and won't need anything else.\n\nHowever since we are required by question statement to give a numerical value for how much money will be spent (and given existing plants), let's find out her initial flower bed total area using 7 feet width of plant:\n \n- Since she can fit only whole numbers in this problem, the space is always going to end up being an even number.\n   Thus we consider her available spaces: \n\n    - A single group has a width occupied by one unit including empty spaces between two plants = 19\n\nGiven these points, let's do our calculations with existing plant count so that we can still get correct final result:\n\n- Total space she will be using to put flowers is:\n     The flower bed length of: \n    - 144 feet.\n\n7. Now divide the total available garden width by each single group (plant + empty spaces between plants) in order to find out how many groups or plant sets can fit there:\n   \n   So we get an equation with number of whole units being equal to 144 /19 \n\n8. Next, let's multiply this result by cost per flower (¥5). Since the actual space including width occupied is 19 feet for each group and since she already has plants so that her available spaces in total can be calculated using following formula:\n    - Total area = length * number of groups or plant sets.\n\n9. Now we will use division to find out how many more flowers are needed.\n   She needs (7) because there is no space left for another one as she already has 10 plants, which means that the garden can only accommodate up to a total of: \n\n    - existing_plants = 10\n   So you need 0 more units.\n\n\n\nStep by step reasoning complete.",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to find the total width of all plants in Olivia's flower bed.\n   The length of her flower bed is 165 feet and she has a space between every plant that needs to be 13.75 feet.\n\n2. Since each row will have one less plant than its number (to leave some space) so we should divide by two the spaces left for plants in this situation, because if you remove all flowers from her garden it would only take up half of what's used.\n   To calculate how many rows Olivia can fit into her flower bed: \n   Number of Flowers = 11\n   So number of empty spots between those is (165 / (13.75 + 3)) -1 \n     we subtract one to remove the extra space after last plant in every row.\n\n    Then total width of plants will be calculated as:\n    \n    Total Width Of Plants = ((Number Of Flowers * Plant Size) + ((number of rows - Number Of Flowers)*empty spots))\n   \n   After calculating number of empty spaces between flowers and removing 1 from it because there is a flower at the end that does not leave any space after itself we can calculate total width occupied by all plants.\n\n3. To find out how many more plants Olivia needs to buy:\n    Total Length Of The Bed = Number Of Flowers * (Plant Size + empty spots) \n   Since this equation will be very close and slightly less than the length of flower bed, she must have bought one extra plant for her garden which can hold its space.\n   \n4. Now let's calculate how much money Olivia spent to fill up her flower bed:\n    Number Of Additional Plants Needed = Total Length Of The Bed / (Plant Size + empty spots) - 11 \n   We subtract 11 from the total number of plants because we already know that she has bought and planted them in garden.\n\n5. Finally, let's multiply this by ₺5 to get a final answer.\n    Money Spent = Number Of Additional Plants Needed * ₺5\n\nNow performing calculations:\n\nFirst calculate how many rows can be put into the flower bed:\n   number of empty spots between flowers is 13.75 feet\n   So we have (165 / (3 + 13.75)) -1 \n     which equals to about 10.\n   \nSo total width occupied by all plants would equal to: \n\n((11 * 6) + ((9)*15))\n    = (66+135)\n    = 201\n\nNow let's calculate the number of additional plants Olivia needs:\n   Total Length Of The Bed / (Plant Size + empty spots) - Number Of Flowers \n     which is (165/16)-11 \n\nSo, we have: \n   Money Spent = ((165/16)-11)* ₺5\n   ≈ 10.5625*₺5\n\nAnswer:\nThe final answer is $52.8125",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n1. First, let's calculate the total distance that Quinn needs to cover with plants and spaces between them in her flower bed of 189 meters length.\nSince we know the width of each plant (5 meters) and space left between every plant (13.5 meters), \nwe can find out how much space will be taken by a single unit of one plant + space, which is 18.5 meters.\n\n2. Now let's divide the total flower bed length with this value to determine the maximum number of these units that Quinn can have in her flower bed:\n189 / 18.5 = 10.243 \nSince we cannot add any fractional plants in our garden, it will be best if we round down to whole numbers.\nThis means a unit (a plant + space) fits into the flowerbed exactly ten times.\n\n3. Now let's determine how many units Quinn can have with her initial flowers of 13:\nQuinn already has these 13 flowers which also occupy some space, so when adding them up we must consider their extra spaces left between.\nTherefore she will add one more plant (14th) and the required gap to reach a total of eleven plants.\n\n4. Since Quinn wants all her flower bed filled with this pattern of flowers + gaps,\nshe can have 11 units in her garden as calculated above.\n\n\n5. Now let's determine how much space these 11 units will take up:\nSince we know that each unit (a plant + gap) takes 18.5 meters, \nwe multiply the number of plants by their total length to get the flower bed coverage: \n\n- Number of units = 11\n- Each unit covers a distance equal to plant width plus space left between them = 18.5 m\n\nCoverage for all these flowers in Quinn's garden will be:\n11 * (5 + 13.5) = 11 * 18.5 meters\n\n\n6. Now let's calculate how much of the flower bed is covered by plants and gaps.\n189 / (5+13.5)=10 units fit into her total space, but since we determined that Quinn will add one more unit to fill it up,\nshe can have a maximum of eleven 18.5m long segments in this case.\n\nHowever given our previous calculation for the number of flower bed coverage was actually equaling 11 * (5+13.5)=220 and not \n189 / (5 + 13.5) =10 units since it seems we're calculating wrong here, Quinn can have at most eleven plants with their respective gaps in her garden.\n\n\n\n7. However let's correct our previous calculation where the number of unit is actually equal to:\n11 *18.5 =220 meters\n\nAnd now that we know how much space they'll cover (220 m), \nlet's calculate how many additional flowers Quinn needs.\n\nWe've calculated 10 units fit into her total garden but she can have eleven so this leaves us with\n- Number of extra spaces or plants required to fill up the flowerbed =11 - 10=1\n\n\n8. Now let's find out how much more space does these two last gaps (for Quinn’s next plant) will cover:\nEach unit is equal to a single gap between flowers plus their width which equals to\n18.5 meters and we already have ten of them in her garden, therefore the remaining space she has left after covering 10 units would be \n189 - 220 =-31.\nHowever this was incorrect since it resulted in negative number,\nit's better if we go back a step (we're allowed) to correct our earlier miscalculation. Quinn will actually have eleven segments of plant + gap which equals total length, i.e., \n11 *18.5= 205.\n\n\n\nSo the remaining space left after covering ten units would be:\n189 - 205 =-16\n\nHowever this is not a good answer since it also resulted in negative number,\nit's better if we go back one more step to correct our earlier miscalculation.\nWe have determined that Quinn has eleven segments of plant + gap which equals total length, i.e., \n11 *18.5= 205.\n\n\n\nBut let’s use another approach this time\nThe remaining space left after covering ten units would be:\n189 - (10*18.5)=2\n\nHowever we cannot divide any garden into fractions so Quinn will add one more unit to fill up her flower bed which was correct and it makes sense.\n\n\nNow that we have corrected our calculation for the number of extra spaces or plants required, \nwe know she needs 1.\n\n9. Now let's find out how many flowers are needed in total:\n- Number of flowers initially =13\n- Additional space left to cover with one more unit (plant + gap) =1\n\nTotal number of flowers Quinn will have: initial flowers + additional flower = 14\n\n\n10.

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \nTo find out how much money Aisha will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to calculate the total number of flowers she needs and multiply it by their cost.\n\nFirstly, let's determine the maximum number of plants that can be placed in a row. Since each plant is 3 meters wide and there should be a gap of 13 meters between every two plants, \nwe add 3 + 13 to get (16) total space for one plant.\nWe divide 182 by the required spacing per flower bed segment plus the width of flowers i.e.,  \n(182 / 16). Then round down since we can't have a fraction part in this case and that gives us, \n11.125 which rounds down is equal to 11.\n\nSince there are 12 rows (calculated from dividing total length by row length) possible with the spacing required for each flower plant,\nthe maximum number of flowers would be 12 * 11 = 132\n\nHowever, we need to verify that this number doesn't exceed Aisha's actual space because a larger number may not fit into her garden.\nSo let us consider other scenario. Now if there are total N plants in the bed and each plant needs (3 + spacing between two flowers) i.e., \n(16)meters of length, then we have,\nTotal Flowers = Total Length / required segment per flower\n= 182/16 which equals to eleven.\nTherefore, The number of rows would be given as follows. If there are a total 'N' plants and each needs (3 + spacing) i.e., \n(13+ 3)meters then we have,\nNumber Of Rows = Total Length / required segment per flower\n= 182/(16).\nSo the maximum possible flowers in N, will equal to 11.\n\nAisha already owns 12 flowers. We can't use this as a row but rather add it into our total plants count so \n132 + 12 - (N) which is same as adding number of rows and multiplying them by length per flower bed segment,\nequals to 144\n\nWe subtract N because we have added the owned plant in each row, i.e., 11 * required space for flowers plus width.\nNow let us add it with 132:\nTotal Flowers = Total Length / (required spacing between two plants + width of one plant)\n= Number Of Rows\nSince there are eleven rows and total length is divided by \n(16)meter. We can simply multiply the number of row i.e., \"11\" to find out how many flowers will be needed.\n\nHowever, Aisha already owns 12 plants so we must add that in our count,\nTotal Flowers = Number Of Rows + owned plant\n= 144\n\nThe cost per flower is $4 at the store. To calculate the total amount of money spent on buying more flowers to fill up her garden:\nwe multiply the number of additional flowers (total - already_owned) by their price.\nSince there are a total 'N' plants and we have added Aisha's plant in every row, i.e., 12 so \n144 - N which is same as adding each row length multiplied with number_of_rows,\nequals to 132.\n\nAdditional Flowers = Total Flowers - Already Owned\n= Number Of Rows * (required spacing between two flowers + width of one flower)\nSince there are eleven rows and total length is divided by required segment per plant i.e., \n(16)meter. We can simply multiply the number of row '11' to find out how many flowers will be needed.\nHowever, Aisha already owns 12 plants so we must add that in our count,\nAdditional Flowers = Total Length / (required spacing between two plants + width of one plant)\n= Number Of Rows\nWe have added each length for N i.e., required segment per flower bed and \nmultiplied by number_of_rows. It gives us total flowers.\nTotal cost will be given as follows:\nCost = Additional Flowers * Price Per Flower\nSince there are a total 'N' plants, we can add 12 in every row to find out how many flowers Aisha needs,\nAdditional Flowers = Number Of Rows \nSo the additional number of flowers that need to be purchased is equal to \"132\".\nTotal cost will be given as follows:\nCost = Additional Flowers * Price Per Flower\n= (Number Of Rows) * price_per_flower\nSince there are eleven rows and total length divided by required segment per plant i.e., \n(16)meter.

First, we need to find out how many plants Elena can fit in her flower bed.\n   To do this, we subtract the width of a plant (5 meters) and the space between each plant (13.0 meters), then divide that total distance by 2 since there is one less gap than number of gaps created from n items:\n   \n   Distance = Length - ((Width + Gap)*n)\n   \n   Here 'Length' equals to 182, 'width plus a gap' in this context will be the plant width (5) added with its space between it and other plants i.e. 13+5=18m,\n   'N', or number of items/gaps is equal to total no. of flowers she has +1 since gaps are created by every item, hence n equals to Elena's current flower count plus one.\n   \n2.

Next, let's find the remaining space left after placing all those flowers:\n   \n   Distance left for more plant placements is not required to solve this problem.\n6. Since there are already some plants (10), Elena needs one more set of 9 spaces i.e., between existing flower bed and a gap from next potential or last possible planting point.\n7.

First, we need to find out how many seats are available for guests in the gymnasium after accounting for graduate and faculty seats.\n   Available seats = Total capacity - Graduate seats - Faculty seats\n                 = 7300 - 550 - 150\n                 = 6600\n\n2. Since tickets will be split equally among graduates, we need to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive if the remaining available seats are given as tickets.\n\n3. As there is no information on total number of students graduating (i.e., 'n'), and also since it was mentioned that tickets were \"split equally\" which implies a division operation - let us assume that we want to know the ticket amount for each graduate in terms of whole numbers only.\n   Therefore, if available seats are 6600 then the possible scenario is when n graduates attend. If this 'n' value will be such as it can divide evenly into 6600.\n\n4. We need to find factors of 6600 which would help us determine how many tickets each graduate could receive.\n\n\n5. Calculating prime factorization for number 6600:\n   Prime Factor: \n        = 2 × 2 (squared)  \n        = 3\n        = 11^2\n6.

Considering the highest possible ticket distribution (i.e., when we have lowest 'n' value) and considering all factors of available seats in order from smallest to largest, then tickets per graduate would be calculated as follows:\n   if n = factor where this will divide evenly into 6600 with quotient greater than or equal to 1 \n      Tickets_per_graduate = 6600/n\n9. In our scenario we have following lowest possible value of 'n' (as factors) such that it meets the conditions in step-8:\n   n=100, therefore tickets per graduate would be as follows: 66\n\n10.

This is calculated by subtracting the seats reserved for graduates and faculty from the total capacity.\n2. Available seats = Total capacity - Graduates' seats - Faculty's seats\n3. Available seats = 4800 - 900 - 300\n\nNow, let's do the calculation:\nAvailable seats = 3600 (by performing subtraction)\n\n4. Since we want to split tickets equally among graduates and they have reserved seats too, \nwe should subtract their number of reserved seats as well from available space before giving them any tickets.\n5. We now need to calculate how many guests will be left after reserving a seat for each graduate.\n\n6. Available seats = 3600 - Number of Graduates (because we are going to give one ticket per guest)\n7. Let's denote the number of graduates as 'N'. \n8. Then, N * Tickets_per_Graduate + Reserved Seats for Faculty and Graduate Students will be equal or less than total available space\n   i.e., 3600 >= Number of Graduates (G) x Ticket to Give per Guest + G + F.\n9. We know the value of 'F' which is 300.\n\n10. Since, N * Tickets_per_Guest + Reserved Seats for Faculty and Graduate Students will be equal or less than total available space,\n    we can write:\n   3600 >= Number of Graduates (G) x Ticket to Give per Guest + G + F\n11. Now, let's assume each graduate gives the same number of tickets 'T'. \n12. So now our inequality becomes:  \n    N * T <= Total available space - Reserved Seats for Faculty and Graduate Students.\n   i.e., 3600 >= Number of Graduates (G) x Ticket to Give per Guest + G.\n\n13. Since we do not have the number of graduates, let's denote 'N' as unknown value.\n14. We know that every graduate needs one seat reserved plus a ticket for each guest they are giving out\n    i.e., N * T + Number of Graduates (G) = Total available space - Reserved Seats for Faculty \n   or equivalently:\n       3600 >= G x Ticket to Give per Guest + G\n\n15. If 'T' is the number of tickets that can be given by a graduate, then each guest will get one ticket and we have: N * T <= 3600\n16. We also know there are reserved seats for faculty members which need not be considered here.\n17. Since graduates also occupy some space (seats), so let's subtract the total number of people occupying seats from available seats in gymnasium to find out how many guests can attend.\n\n18. Now, we'll solve this by assuming that each graduate gets one ticket and divide 3600 - N among G \n   which is equivalent to solving for T = Tickets given per Guest\n\n19. Let's assume the number of graduates as 'N'. \n\n20. Then our problem now becomes finding the maximum value of tickets that can be distributed if we know total available seats, reserved graduate seats and faculty members.\n\n21. From step 18: \n   We need to divide (3600 - N) by Number of Graduates(G). This is because each guest will get one ticket\n      i.e., Tickets_per_Guest = Total_tickets_for_guests / G\n\n22. Now let's consider the case where we do not know how many tickets can be given per graduate.\n\n23. Then, from our inequality equation:\n   (3600 - N) >= Number of Graduates(G) * Ticket_to_distribute + 300\n24. The problem becomes finding a relation between 'T' and 'N'. We see that the left hand side is fixed at 3300 for all possible values \n   i.e., tickets to distribute among guests = (3600 - N).\n25. Therefore, we can equate right-hand sides of inequalities from steps:23 and 20.\n\n26. Now our problem simplifies:\n    Number_of_Guests x Ticket_to_distribute + G >= Total_seats_for_guests\n27. Also, since each guest gets one ticket,\n   Tickets_per_Guest = (Total_tickets_for_guests) / N\n\n28. Therefore from equations: 20 and step :26 we get \n      N * T <= 3600 - Number of Graduates(G)\n29. From steps:23,24 the equation becomes:\n    Total_seats_for_guests >= G x Ticket_to_distribute + G\n30. Since each guest gets one ticket so Tickets_per_Guest = (Total_tickets_for_guests) / N.\n31. Therefore from equations 26 and step :20 we get \n   N * T <= Total available space - Reserved Seats for Faculty\n\n32. To find 'T' which is number of tickets per graduate, let's assume",

Multiply the number of carrots peeled by a minute (which is 6) with the total amount of minutes available, which is 11:\n    6 * 11 = 66\n\n3. Since Sophia can saute 45 carrots in those same 11 minutes and we have calculated that she peels 66 carrots during this time frame,\n   it means that for all 90 carrots (which includes the peeled as well), it will take her a bit more than just these 11 minutes.\n\n4. Let's calculate how many carrots Sophia can saute in one minute:\n    She has sauted 45 carrots over 11 minutes.\n    Divide number of carrots by total amount of time: \n    45 / 11 = approximately 4.09 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\n5. Multiply the calculated rate at which she peels/sautes a carrot per minute, with total desired outcome:\n   First, let's consider sauteing all of those carrots in one go and then we'll add time needed for peeling them.\n    The result would be 90 / (4.09) = approximately 22\n\n6. It will take her around the calculated minutes to only peel/saute these carrots at that rate, however this does not account for the extra step of first peeling all those carrots.\n\n7. Let's now add time it takes her just to peel them:\n   As we know from our calculations earlier she can peel 66 in eleven and has a target number which is slightly less than twice as many: \n    If she needs only another minute or two more, this would still fit within the calculated range of peeling/sauteing all carrots at once.",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. Nadia can peel 14 mushrooms a minute, so to find the time it takes for her to peel x mushrooms, we divide x by 14.\n\n2. To saute y mushrooms in 17 minutes at a rate of 20 mushrooms per 17 minutes, we first need to calculate how many mushrooms she can saute in one minute: \n   (y / ((y/20) * 17)) = 1\n   We are trying to solve for the time it takes her. This will result in y being equal to (20*17)/x and so is a constant, meaning that no matter how many mushrooms she has to saute we can divide by this number of minutes.\n\n3. To peel and saute x mushrooms, let's say peeling 140-x mushrooms for some unknown time 'a', and then sautéing the remaining (x) mushrooms in an unknown amount of time 'b'. The total time will be a + b.\n   We know that Nadia can peel y mushrooms per minute so she would need to take x/14 minutes or more, but we don't have this information yet.\n\n4. To saute 140-x mushrooms takes the same amount of time as it does for her to sauté 1 mushroom multiplied by (x-0) = b.\n   We also know from step two that a constant number of minutes is required regardless of how many she has left, so this will always equal x/20*17.\n\n5. To find the total amount of time we add steps three and four together to get our final equation for 't': t= (140-x)/14 + 17x/20.\n   However since peeling is a process that happens at a constant rate, there must be some minimum value of x so that this expression can actually equal the total amount of time. The best candidate would then be when Nadia only has to peel one mushroom and sauté none (i.e., 140 -x =0). This gives us t=10.\n\n6. At this point it's clear we need a way for x to grow large, but also small enough so that peeling doesn't become impractically slow. Therefore the value of 't' when Nadia has peeled one mushroom and sautéed none will be our final answer.\n   This is because if she only had 1 more mushroom then it would take her an extra minute to peel, but this wouldn’t actually help us solve for how long peeling takes (because there’s no upper limit), however in order to make the process faster and therefore give a better estimate we can try setting x equal to one less than our target of y mushrooms. This way when Nadia only has 1 mushroom left then it will take her an extra minute, but this won’t actually help us solve for how long peeling takes (because there’s no upper limit), however in order to make the process faster and therefore give a better estimate we can try setting x equal to one less than our target of y mushrooms. \n\n7. Since Nadia needs at least 14 minutes to peel all of them, this is already larger then t =10 that she needed when there was only 1 mushroom left.\n   Therefore the best candidate would be if Nadia peeled and sautéed x=140-13 or a total number of mushrooms equal to 127.\n\n8. In order for us to calculate how long it takes her, we will simply put this value into our equation from step five: \nt = (140 - 127)/14 + 17*127/20.\nWe can then plug in the numbers and solve:\nt=13/14+2163/20\n   t=(2600-3648) /420 \n    t=-1048 /420 \n\n9. We know that Nadia needs at least x =140 minutes to peel all of them, but this is already larger than our answer from step 7.\nTherefore the best candidate would be if she peeled and sautéed a total number equal to (127*14 +20) or more.\n\n10. Since peeling mushrooms takes longer then it does to saute them we can safely say that Nadia will take at least x=140+17-1 =156 minutes, since this is the smallest possible value of time she could possibly need.\n   In order for us to calculate how long it would actually take her to peel and sauté all 140 mushrooms, we simply plug in the numbers into our equation from step five:\nt=(140/14)+17*140/20\nwe can then solve this: \n   t=10+119 \n    The total time for Nadia is equal to 129 minutes.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is $\\boxed{129}$.",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \n1. First, let's find out how many mushrooms Kayla can peel per minute and saute per 14 minutes.\n   - She peels 5 mushrooms a minute.\n   - In 14 minutes, she would be able to peel (5 * 14) = 70 mushrooms.\n\n2. Now we need to determine her rate of mushroom preparation in total for both actions combined since it's given that sauteing is done with the same set of mushrooms being peeled by Kayla at a different time frame than peeling alone.\n   - We can see from above she could peel up to 70 but only needs 180. And, we know her rate when peeling which would be needed for both actions in order to make calculations possible.\n\n3. Since it is given that sauteing takes 14 minutes and Kayla wants a total of (peeled + sautéed) mushrooms = 180\n   - It seems reasonable to calculate how many sets she needs, since we know the time taken by peeling one set as well.\n   \n4. In order for her to peel 70 mushrooms which is the rate at which peels are done in 14 minutes and then sauté them all, let's find out what it will take if there were only a need of doing that task once:\n   - Since she needs (peeled + sauteed) = 180. And has peeled or can peel up to the rate of 70 mushrooms for each set\n   We are trying to figure how many times in order to do this.\n\n5. Therefore we get our number by dividing total mushroom count that is needed, which will be done with peeling and sautéing together (i.e., the task) - so if she has a rate of 70 for one set:\n   - We have to divide it into sets as many times as possible until getting enough mushrooms i.e. in this case we would need total = 180 / 70\n\n6. This is an approximation since peeling and sautéing are separate processes that can't be exactly synchronized, however if the question wants you just do a number then follow these steps.\n   - Doing so:\n     (peeled + sauteed) mushrooms needed for both actions = total set * rate of one mushroom action \n   \n7. This would lead to finding how many times we need peeling or sautéing 70 in order get our goal which will be done with following a simple division equation.\n   - Therefore:\n     (total / each_set)\n     \n8. Since it is said that mushrooms are peeled at the rate of 5 per minute and also she can prepare another set for sauteeing after every one set i.e., peeling has to wait while sautéing happens \n    this makes sense to divide total number of mushroom required by a factor which represents combined rate - so we could do (total / each_set). However, here in our case there is an additional condition that she only can prepare up to the maximum amount possible for both peeling and sauting action\n   The best way would be to calculate it using the actual time needed if you have a fixed total of 180 mushrooms so that we could make use of her combined rate which has been given in this question i.e., peeling at one end (5/min) while other is being prepared for cooking.\n   \n9. We will follow our equation - by plugging numbers into it:\n   - time_taken = ((total_mushrooms / total_set))\n     where, we would be calculating the combined rate of peeling and sautéing that Kayla can do together at one point in order to make her task easier.\n\n10. Let's calculate how long she will take by substituting given values:\n    - We know from previous steps: \n      - total_set = 70 mushrooms\n    Therefore, we could say the time it takes for this process is calculated as follows and that is equal to ((180 / 70))\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 2.57",

    "logic_problem": {
      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \n1. Uma can peel 5 clams a minute, so to peel 140 clams it will take her:\n   Time = Number of Clams / Rate per Minute\n         = 140 clams / 5 clams/minute\n         = 28 minutes.\n2. To saute 35 clams in 18 minutes means she can saute at a rate of:\n   Rate per minute = Total Clams / Time \n                   = 35 clams / 18 minutes (for sauting)  \n3. Now, to find the time it takes her to sauté and peel all 140 clams, let's first calculate how many sets of peeling she can do in that 28 mins:\n   Since Uma can only peel for 28 mins, we don't need to consider anything beyond this duration.\n4. She can complete a full set (peel + saute) by spending the initial 18 minutes on one clam. Now let's find out how many such sets she needs in total: \n    Number of Clams / Rate per minute for peeling and then multiply that by time it takes to peel them\n5. In each complete cycle, Uma can only process a maximum number of clams equaling 35 (as seen from the rate provided) as she has limited sauté capacity.\n6. Let’s now determine how many such cycles are needed for peeling: \n   Cycles = Number of Clams / Rate per minute\n          = 140/5   \n         = 28\n\nSince we know that Uma needs to make a complete set (peel + saute) and she can peel at the rate mentioned. Since, time is fixed at 18 minutes for peeling clams and so the calculation of the number of full sets will be\n7. Number of Clam Sets = Total Time / Set Duration \n                      = 28 mins/18 min (for peeling + sauté)\n8. She can process a maxiumum of one set every time it takes her to peel these clams, given that she only has limited capacity in terms of how much she could actually saute within the timeframe provided.\n\n9. The number of complete sets is 1 as Uma needs an equal amount of peeling and sauting for each clam processed.\n10. Since we know this rate (35 clams), let's now find out if it matches with our calculation above: \n    Total Clam Sets = Number of Complete Cycles * Rate per Cycle\n                   = 28 cycles* 1 set/cycle \n                   \n\n11. The total number of sets that Uma can make is indeed equal to the cycle count which makes sense as she needs a complete peeling and saute time.\n12. We now know, Uma has an additional capacity left unutilized from this calculation but in order to get our final answer we need to just use it for its face value.\n\n13. Since each set can hold 35 clams (given the rate mentioned), \n    Total Clams Processed = Number of Sets * Rate per Set\n                         = 28 sets* 35 clam/set\n\n\n14. The calculation gives us a total number that is very close to our initial target which indeed matches as this would be a natural limit.\n\n15. It seems we might not need any further steps since the question already contains all relevant information and Uma’s capacity should suffice for processing these clams in accordance with her rate.\n\nAnswer: \nThe final answer is 28",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's calculate the total number of apartments in the first 3 complexes:\n   Total = Number of apartments per complex * Number of complexes\n   Total = 400 * 3\n   Total = 1200\n\n2. The last apartment has 55% more than these three combined, which is an increase over 1200.\n   Increase amount = (Increase percentage / 100) * Original number\n   Increase amount for the other three complexes' total = (55/100)*1200 \n   Total of all apartments including the fourth complex would be:   \n   NewTotal= 1200 + (55/100*1200)\n   Simplify this to get:\n   Newtotal = 1860\n\n3. Next, let's calculate how many collections Benjamin makes per week from each place.\n   Collections Per Week From Each Place = Garbage Collection Frequency * Number of Apartments\n   Since he collects garbage four times a week, the total number of collections for all places in a week will be:\n   TotalCollectionsPerWeek = 4 * NewTotal\n\n   Simplify this to get: \n    TotalCollectionsPerWeek=4*1860   \n     This simplifies further to become 7440.\n\n4. Now we calculate how much money he makes per collection.\n   Money Per Collection For Each Apartment = ₣0.25\n5. Next, let's multiply the total number of collections and money collected for each one in a week:\n   TotalMoneyMadePerWeek = (₣0.25/Collection) * CollectionsPerWeek   \n    This simplifies to: \n     7440* .25\n\n6. Simplify this expression further\n   To get final value we multiply, giving the answer of 1860",

      "question": "Ravi collects garbage from 5 different apartment complexes. The first 4 have 350 apartments each and the last one is 70% bigger than the other 4 combined. Ravi collects garbage 5 times a week from each place and he gets paid ¥0.5 per collection for each apartment. How much money does he make in a week?",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n1. First, we need to find the total number of apartments in the first 4 complexes.\n   - There are 5 complexes with 350 apartments each (except for one), so: \n     Complexes_1_to_4 = Number_of_complexes * Apartments_per_complex\n      Complexes_1_to_4 = 4 * 350\n\n2. Now, calculate Complexes_1_to_4.\n   - Complexes_1_to_4 = 1400 apartments.\n\n3. The last complex is 70% bigger than the other 4 combined (Complexes_1_to_4), \n   so we need to find its size first: Size_of_last_complex = (1 + 0.7) * Complexes_1_to_4.\n   - Since it's an increase of 70%, we add that as a decimal and then multiply by the number of apartments in the other complexes.\n\n4. Calculate the size of last complex:\n   - Size_of_last_complex = 1.7 * 1400\n     Size_of_last_complex = 2380\n\n5. Now, find total number of apartments: Total_apartments = Complexes_1_to_4 + Size_of_last_complex.\n   - This will give us the overall size.\n\n6. Calculate the total:\n   - Total_apartments = 1400 + 2380\n     Total_apartments = 3780\n\n7. Ravi collects garbage from each complex 5 times a week and gets paid ¥0.5 per collection for each apartment, \n   so we need to find out his weekly earnings: Weekly_earnings_per_complex = (Number_of_collections * Price_per_collection) * Apartments_in_complex.\n   - Multiply number of collections by price per collection then multiply that result with the total apartments.\n\n8. Calculate the weekly earnings:\n   - First calculate the amount earned for one complex in a week\n     Weekly_earnings_one_complex = 5 * ¥0.5 * 350 \n       Weekly_earnings_one_complex = ¥875 \n\n9. Now, since we know Ravi has to do this five times (once from each), multiply by total complexes.\n   - Total_weekly_earnings_all_apartments = Number_of_complexes * Weekly_earnings_one_complex\n     However for his job he is doing it 5 time a week so that needs to be factored in, which will look like this:\n      Total_weekly_earnings_Ravi = (Number_of_complexes) * (Weekly_earnings_per_collection_for_each_complex)\n       Weekly earnings from all the complexes multiplied by how many times per weeks he collects\n\n10. Calculate total weekly earning.\n    - Multiply ¥875 for one complex with 5 collections a week to find out his rate per collection, then multiply that result by number of apartment places\n      Total_weekly_earnings_Ravi = (¥0.50 * 350) * 5 * Number_of_complexes\n        Since all other values are known we can plug them in now.\n       ¥875 * 5\n\n11. Now calculate total:\n    - This is equal to: \n     Weekly earnings of Ravi's job per week with the numbers inserted would be as follows.\n   Total_weekly_earnings_Ravi = (¥0.50) * ¥350 * 5\n      Then since he collects from all five complexes we can multiply by number_of_complexes, however this value is already taken into account in the calculation above.\n\n12. Calculate total weekly earnings:\n    - Weekly earnings per collection: \n     Ravis_weekly_earnings = ¥875\n\n13. So his weekly earnings would be as follows.\n   Total_weekly_Ravi = ¥ 4375 \n\nAnswer: The final answer is $¥4375$.",

      "question": "Jin collects garbage from 3 different apartment complexes. The first 2 have 200 apartments each and the last one is 20% bigger than the other 2 combined.

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \n1. First, let's calculate the number of apartments in the first 2 complexes:\n   Number of apartments = 200 + 200\n                         = 400\n2. Next, we'll find out how many more apartments are there in the last complex compared to the other two combined.\n   The total for all three is going to be a little over one and half times that number because it's 20% bigger than both of them added together:\n   For every hundred units you add twenty percent - which can also be expressed as (100 + 0.2 * 100), we get 120.\n3. Now, let’s calculate the total apartments for all three complexes combined and then find out how many more are there in the last complex compared to both of them:\n   Total = (400) x 1.5 \n         = 600\n4. The extra number of apartment units in the third block is going to be what's left after removing the first two blocks' total from this final value, which can also be expressed as: 600 - 400.\n    Extra apartments = 200\n\nNow we know that there are a total of (Extra + First Two) or 200+ 400= 600 units in all three apartment complexes. \n5. Since the last complex has an extra 20% more, it must have:\n   Total number of apartments = 120 * ((200/100))\n                              = 240\n6. Now that we know how many total units there are across both blocks and which one is bigger by what amount, let's now calculate Jin’s earnings.\n7. To find the weekly income from all complexes combined: \n    First two apartment complexes:\n     Weekly collections per complex * (3 times) = 200*0.3*(3)\n = €180\n     Total for first block of apartments is going to be (2 blocks multiplied by what you calculated earlier): \n     Income for the second set of buildings that are not bigger will also equal: \n    The final amount Jin collects from both these smaller apartment complexes would be 400 *0.3*3=€360.\n8. Last but not least we have earnings coming in weekly, which is going to come out to (240) multiplied by the number you found above:\n   Income for bigger block = €(240)*((0.30)*(3)) \n                          = €216\n9. Lastly add what Jin collects from all three apartment complexes together and you get your answer.\n   Total income per week: 360 + 216=€576\n\nAnswer: The final answer is $576",
