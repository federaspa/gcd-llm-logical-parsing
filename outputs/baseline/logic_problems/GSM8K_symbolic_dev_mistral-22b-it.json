Now, to find out how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city of 56 miles, we multiply the time taken per mile by the total distance: \\( 14.5357 \\times 56 = 815.9992 \\) minutes (rounded to four decimal places).\n4. Since we need a precise answer and the context of the problem suggests that it should be an integer, we round up to the nearest whole minute because the fog bank will take slightly longer than calculated due to incremental coverage.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 816 minutes.",

Then her speed on the sidewalk is \\( 2v \\) km/min since it's twice as fast.\n2. We know that she spends 57 minutes walking on the beach, so we can write an equation for the distance covered on the beach: \\( 19 = v \\times 57 \\). Solving this gives us her speed on the beach: \\( v = \\frac{19}{57} \\) km/min.\n3. Now that we have her walking speed on the beach, we can find out how long it takes for her to walk on the sidewalk using the equation \\( 12 = (2v)t_{sidewalk} \\). Substituting in our value of \\( v \\), we get: \\( t_{sidewalk} = \\frac{12}{2\\times\\left(\\frac{19}{57}\\right)} \\).\n4. Calculating this gives us \\( t_{sidewalk} = 38 \\) minutes on the sidewalk.\n5. To find out how long it takes for her to complete the entire walk, we add up the time spent walking on the beach and the sidewalk: \\( 57 + 38 = 95 \\) minutes in total.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is **95** minutes.",

Adding these together gives us the total time spent watching TV from Thursday to Monday (excluding Saturday): 8 + 4.75 + 9 = 21.75 hours.\n3. We know that James watched a total of 23 hours over the five days, so we can subtract the time already accounted for to find out how much time he spent watching TV on Saturday: 23 - 21.75 = 1.25 hours or 75 minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).\n4.

On Friday, after finishing his homework early, he watched a 5-hour episode and a 30-minute show. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is equal to 0.5 hours. So, on Friday, he watched 5 + 0.5 = 5.5 hours of TV.\n4. On Saturday, he got to stay up late and watched two 2-hour episodes, which adds up to 2 * 2 = 4 hours.\n5. Now, let's calculate the total hours Luis watched on Tuesday through Friday: 10 (Tue & Wed) + 5.5 (Fri) = 15.5 hours.\n6. Subtracting this from the overall total of 21 hours gives us the time he spent watching TV on Thursday: 21 - 15.5 = 5.5 hours.\n7. Since each episode on Thursday was 45 minutes long, we need to convert his viewing time into minutes and then divide by the length of one episode to find out how many episodes he watched.

      "raw": " Step by step reasoning:\n1. First, let's find out how many calories are in one ounce of the bag. Since there are 5 servings in a 300-ounces bag with each serving having 275 calories, we can calculate as follows:\n   Total calories = Number of servings * Calories per serving\n   5 servings * 275 calories/serving = 1375 calories\n\n2. Now, let's determine how many more calories you can consume to reach your daily target without exceeding it:\n   Remaining calories = Daily calorie target - Consumed calories\n   2360 calories - 1700 calories = 660 calories\n\n3. Next, we need to find out how many ounces of the bag you can eat with your remaining calorie allowance. Since one ounce is equivalent to:\n   Calories per ounce = Total calories / Total weight in ounces\n   1375 calories / 300 ounces = 4.5833 calories/ounce (approximately)\n\n4.

      "raw": " Step by step reasoning:\n1. Calculate the total cost of cotton candy without discounts: 23 pounds * $22 per pound = $506.\n2. Determine the discounted amount for the extra 5 pounds and 1/4 off: (5 + 1/4) pounds * ($22 - (1/4)*$22) per pound = (5.25) pounds * $16.5 per pound = $87.375.\n3. Calculate the total discounted cost for cotton candy: $506 - $87.375 = $418.625.\n4. Add the cost of the mixed bag of coral pieces and pins to get the total spending: $11.5 + (16 * $21.25) = $11.5 + $340 = $351.5.\n5. Sum up all expenses: $418.625 + $351.5 = $769.125.\n6. Subtract the total spending from the initial amount to find how much money Rania has left: $1400 - $769.125 = $630.875.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is $630.88 (rounded to the nearest cent).",

      "raw": " Step by step reasoning:\n1. First, calculate the price increase for the more expensive brand of flour. The normal brand costs â‚¬20 per kilogram, and the more expensive brand is 35% more. So, the increased cost per kilogram is \\( \\frac{35}{100} \\times 20 = â‚¬7 \\).\n2. Therefore, the price for the more expensive flour is \\( â‚¬20 + â‚¬7 = â‚¬27 \\) per kilogram.\n3. Ibrahim needs a week's worth of flour and uses 1 kilogram per day. So he needs to buy \\( 7 \\times 1 = 7 \\) kilograms of the more expensive brand.\n4. The total cost for the flour is \\( â‚¬27 \\times 7 = â‚¬189 \\).\n5. He also buys a muffin that costs â‚¬2, so add this to the total cost: \\( â‚¬189 + â‚¬2 = â‚¬191 \\).\n6.

We can calculate this using the formula Time = Total Work / Rate. So, Time_peeling = 140 clams / 7 clams/minute = 20 minutes.\n2. Next, we need to determine how long it will take her to saute all the peeled clams at a rate of 20 clams every 16 minutes. Since she has already peeled 140 clams in 20 minutes, and this is within the time frame for one batch of sautÃ©ing (16 minutes), we can assume that she will start cooking them immediately after peeling.\n3. Now, let's calculate how many batches of clams Uma needs to cook. She can cook 20 clams in each batch and has a total of 140 clams. So, Number_of_batches = Total clams / Clams per batch = 140 clams / 20 clams/batch = 7 batches.\n4. Since each batch takes 16 minutes to cook, the total cooking time will be Time_cooking = Number_of_batches * Cooking_time_per_batch = 7 batches * 16 minutes/batch = 112 minutes.\n5. Finally, we need to add both times together (peeling and sautÃ©ing) to find out the total time required: Total_time = Time_peeling + Time_cooking = 20 minutes + 112 minutes = 132 minutes.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 132 minutes.",

      "raw": " Step by step reasoning:\n1. First, we need to convert the length of Theo's office from yards to feet because the area is given in square feet and we want the perimeter in feet as well. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, then 9 yards = 9 * 3 = 27 feet.\n2. Next, let's denote the width of Theo's office as W (in feet). We know that Area = Length Ã— Width and given the area is 837 square feet, so we have:\n   837 ftÂ² = 27 ft * W\n   Therefore, W = 837 ftÂ² / 27 ft = 31 feet.\n3. Now, to find the perimeter (P) of Theo's office, which is a rectangle, we use the formula: P = 2 Ã— Length + 2 Ã— Width. So in this case, it would be:\n   P = 2 * 27 ft + 2 * 31 ft\n   P = 54 ft + 62 ft\n   P = 116 feet\nAnswer: The final answer is 116",

      "raw": " Step by step reasoning:\n1. First, calculate the total number of hours Ali works in a week. Since he works 6-hour shifts each day for 3 days a week, we have:\n   Total weekly hours = 6 hours/day * 3 days/week = 18 hours/week\n2. Next, calculate Ali's weekly earnings from his hourly wage. He earns Â¥11 per hour, so:\n   Weekly earnings (without bonus) = 18 hours/week * Â¥11/hour = Â¥198/week\n3. Now, add the performance bonus to find out Ali's total weekly earnings when the company performs well:\n   Total weekly earnings (with bonus) = Â¥198 + Â¥432 = Â¥630/week\n4. Finally, calculate Ali's earnings for the entire month of July, which has 4 weeks:\n   Monthly earnings in July = Â¥630/week * 4 weeks = Â¥2520\n\nAnswer: The final answer is Â¥2520",

When Arash saw it for the second time, he was four times older than his uncle was when the uncle saw it (four times 21).\n3. So, Arash's age at the second sighting = 4 * 21 = 84 years old.\n4. To find out how old Arash was during the first sighting, we subtract one orbit period from his age at the second sighting (since he saw it twice in his lifetime).\n5.

However, we know that Theo saw it a second time when he was two times the age his father was. So, let's assume Theo's first viewing of the Comet made him X years old.\n3. When Theo is X + 90 (second viewing), he would be twice as old as his father was during his first viewing: X + 90 = 2 * 47 = 94.\n4. Therefore, Theo's age at the second viewing minus 90 years gives us his age at the first viewing: X = 94 - 90 = 4.\n5.

Yusuf saw the comet for the second time in 1960, which is when he was two times the age his grandfather was when he saw the Comet. So, Yusuf's age = 2 * 43 = 86 years old.\n3. To find out how old Yusuf was when he first saw the comet, we need to subtract one orbit of the comet from this year because his grandfather also saw it at some point in time before him. So, 1900 - (2 * 60) = 1780 is the year when Yusuf's grandfather first saw the Comet and Yusuf would have been born around that same year or shortly after because he saw it for the second time at age 86.\n4. Therefore, if we assume Yusuf was born right before his grandfather passed away (in 1795), then when he first saw the comet in 1820 (which is one orbit later), he would have been approximately 35 years old since 1820 - 1785 = 35.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 35.",

We know he caught 6 trouts with specific weights for the first and last ones (51 kg and 21 kg respectively). However, the problem doesn't provide weights for the other four trouts or an average weight for them.\n2. Since we can't determine the total weight of all trouts from the given information alone, let's assume Ali caught the same number of trouts between each specific catch: 4 trouts before the first one and 1 trout after the last one. This would make it a consistent distribution for simplicity.\n3. Now we can estimate the average weight per trout based on what we have: (51 kg + 21 kg) / 2 = 72 kg/2 = 36 kg average weight per specific catch. Assuming this is representative of all catches, then each unspecified trout also weighs approximately 36 kg.\n4. So the total estimated weight would be: (51 kg + 45 kg + 36 kg * 2) + 36 kg = 270 kg for the first three and last catches, plus another 36 kg for each of the remaining two trouts. That's a total estimate of 270 kg + (2 * 36 kg) = 342 kg.\n5. Given that one kilogram of trout costs $0.5, Ali would earn: 342 kg * $0.5/kg = $171 for all the trouts.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is $171",

Since he has 7 regular periods plus 2 extra classes each day, and each class is 35 minutes long, we have:\n   Total weekly minutes = 9 periods/day * 35 minutes/period * 6 days = 1890 minutes.\n\n2. Next, let's find out how much time he spends on extra learning during the weekends (Saturday and Sunday). He uses five-sixths of his weekly class time for this purpose:\n   Extra learning minutes = (5/6) * 1890 minutes = 1575 minutes.\n\n3. Now, let's add up all the time he spends on classes and extra learning to get the total hours spent learning per week:\n   Total learning time in minutes = 1890 minutes (weekdays) + 2 * 1575 minutes (weekend) = 4965 minutes.\n\n4.

To find out how much he spent on snacks:\n   \\( â‚¬1400 \\times 0.98 = â‚¬1367.2 \\) (rounded to two decimal places).\n2. The cost of one bag of crackers is â‚¬0.25, and the cost of one popcorn is â‚¬0.50. Let's denote the number of popcorn Faisal bought as \\( P \\), so the total amount spent on popcorn would be:\n   \\( 0.5P \\).\n3. The amount left for crackers after buying popcorn would then be:\n   \\( â‚¬1367.2 - 0.5P \\).\n4. Since Faisal bought 6 bags of crackers, the equation becomes:\n   \\( 6 \\times 0.25 = â‚¬1367.2 - 0.5P \\)\n   Simplifying this gives us:\n   \\( â‚¬1.5 + 0.5P = â‚¬1367.2 \\).\n5.

We are told that 21 engineers stayed, which suggests an inconsistency because there were only 34 engineers initially and more than 34 cannot stay if they all left.

Since the initial number of nurses is 21, and assuming all engineers left (which would be incorrect but let's follow this path to resolve), we need to determine how many nurses stayed.

Since there were initially more nurses than remaining attendees (21 nurses and 22 people remaining), it implies some nurses must have also left.

Given 34 out of possible 21 remaining fits incorrectly in context logically; thus interpreting the consistent step correctly resolving \\(55 - 33 = 22\\) people remain and among them still includes nurses fitting within initial constraints leading to correct derivation.\n9.

Since she gets 140 meters more than Quinn, let's denote the amount of fence Quinn gets as Q and the amount Amelia gets as A. So, A = Q + 140.\n2. The total length of the fence is 620 meters, so we can write the equation: Q + (Q + 140) = 620.\n3. Simplifying the equation gives us: 2Q + 140 = 620.\n4. Subtracting 140 from both sides of the equation, we get: 2Q = 480.\n5. Dividing both sides by 2 to solve for Q, we find that Quinn gets: Q = 240 meters of fence.\n6. To check if Amelia's portion is correct, we calculate A as follows: A = Q + 140 = 240 + 140 = 380 meters.\n7. Adding both amounts together to verify the total length: 240 (Quinn) + 380 (Amelia) = 620 meters, which matches the given total length of fence.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is that Quinn has 240 meters of fence left over for her.",

According to the problem, the total amount of fencing they have together is 340 meters. So we can write an equation for this: x + (x + 50) = 340.\n3. Simplifying the left side of the equation gives us 2x + 50. Now our equation looks like this: 2x + 50 = 340.\n4. To solve for x, we subtract 50 from both sides to get rid of that constant term on one side: 2x = 340 - 50 which simplifies to 2x = 290.\n5. Divide both sides by 2 to find the value of x (the amount Nia gets): x = 290 / 2, so x = 145 meters for Nia.\n6. Since Keisha gets 50 more meters than Nia: 145 + 50 = 195 meters for Keisha.\n7. To find how much is left over for Nia, we subtract what Keisha gets from the total amount of fencing: 340 - 195 = 145 meters.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 145",

Adding up all the paid hours gives us a total cost of Â¥31 + Â¥62 + Â¥124 + Â¥248 + Â¥496 + Â¥992.\n6. Calculating this sum: Â¥31 + Â¥62 = Â¥93, then Â¥93 + Â¥124 = Â¥217, followed by Â¥217 + Â¥248 = Â¥465, and finally Â¥465 + Â¥496 = Â¥961.\n7.

      "raw": " Step by step reasoning:\n1. First, let's find out how long it takes Olga to swim a mile on a warm day (hot day). Thrice as long as 16 minutes is $3 \\times 16 = 48$ minutes. Nine more than that would be $48 + 9 = 57$ minutes.\n2. Now, let's calculate the time it takes Olga to swim two miles on a cold day and on a warm (hot) day:\n   - On a cold day: It takes her $16 \\times 2 = 32$ minutes for two miles.\n   - On a hot day: It would take her $57 + 9 = 66$ minutes to swim the second mile after already swimming one, so in total it's $66 + 57 = 123$ minutes for two miles.\n3. Finally, we subtract the time on a cold day from that of a hot day: $123 - 32 = 91$.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 91.",

So, there will be 150 * 4 = 600 new infections.\n   Total infected at end of day 3: 150 (previous total) + 600 (new) = 750 people.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 750.",
