Substituting in our value for the number of tennis balls we calculated earlier gives us:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Brown Tennis Balls} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 88\n   \\]\n\n5. Performing this final calculation, we get:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Brown Tennis Balls} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 88 = 44 \n    \\]\nAnswer: The final answer is 44 brown tennis balls.",

Similarly, since she walks at two times her speed on sidewalk,\n     we can say that it would take (13 miles / ((2v)*minutes))\n      = 7 hours or 420 minutes.\n\nTotal time taken for the entire walk is:\n   total_time= beach_walk + sidewalk_walk\n       =(5+420) = 425 min\n\nAnswer: The final answer is \nThe solution to this question indicates that it takes Fatima a total of **425** minutes to complete her daily walking on both parts.",

Total time taken will be divided into two parts - first for the walk on the beach (48 minutes), then rest of walking.\n   Time spent in other part can be calculated by dividing total distance \n       walked per day with speed at sidewalk:\n      \\( \\text{Time}_{sidewalk} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Speed}_{\\text{sidewalk}}}=\n              \\frac{30}{45}= 1/2\\) hour.\n\n7. Total time taken for the whole walk is sum of beach and other parts, \n       which gives us: \\(T_{total} = T_{beach} + Time_{sidewalk}\n             = 48+0.5=48.5 \\) hours.\n  \nAnswer: The final answer is 48.5",

Since there are two such episodes per day:\nTotal for Sundays & Mondays = 2 * 4 hours\n\nNext, we'll add up all his other daily television viewing times:\n- Tuesday: He watched some unknown number (let's call this N) of shows that lasted 15 minutes each.\n- Wednesday: He finished homework early and watched a 4-hour episode followed by a 45-minute show. That totals to an additional 8 hours, or 4 * 60 minutes = 240 minutes.\n- Thursday: On Thursdays he stayed up late watching two episodes that lasted for three hours each. This adds another 3 hour x (1/2) day = 90 more minutes.\n\nNow we know the total time spent on these other days:\nTotal + Wednesday's additional shows and Thursday night viewing\n= Total Sundays & Mondays + Tuesday unknowns + Wednesday's unknown plus Thursday's long show\n\nGiven that Luca watched a total of 19 hours, let's calculate what he had already accounted for with his Sunday/Monday episodes.\nLet S be the number of minutes in an hour. We know:\n4 * (2) = 8 hours\nTotal time on Sundays & Mondays: 8S + N*15\n\nNow we can set up our equation to solve for N:\n\n(8S + N*15) + Total Wednesday and Thursday shows plus Saturday's unknowns \n= Total of all days including the ones not yet accounted, which is:\n240 (from Tuesday)\n90 minutes from Thursday\n3 * 60 = 180 total hours\n\nNow we sum these up:\n\n(8S + N*15) + [Total Wednesday and Thursday shows plus Saturday's unknowns]\n= Sums all days including the ones not yet accounted, which is:\n240 (from Tuesday)\n90 minutes from Thursday\n3 * 60 = 180 total hours\n\nThe sum of our known values on other weekdays should be equal to what we know Luca spent watching in total.

First, we need to determine how many items of each type Quinn will make for her 3 grandchildren.\n   - Vests: 7\n   - Cardigans: 7 (since they are triplets)\n   - Beanie hats: 7\n   - Gloves: Since gloves come in pairs and there's no information about individual ones, we'll assume itâ€™s just one type of glove for each grandchild. So that would be 3.\n   - Booties: As with the gloves, booties are also paired so again assuming only one pair per child means another 3.\n\n2. Now letâ€™s sum these up:\n   Total number items = Vests + Cardigans + Beanie hats + Gloves (paired) + Boots\n                        = 7+7+7+6*1/2+8*(2)\n\n            Here, we divided by two for gloves since they come in pairs and multiplied the number of boots per child with it as each pair would be same.\n\n3.

Finally, let's determine how many days are there in three weeks?\n    Days in three weeks = 21\n\n5. The total number of unoccupied rooms after the admissions is:\n   Unoccupied rooms remaining = Total capacity - (Occupied capacity + Admitted patients)\n                                = 800 - (700 + 630) \n                                = 800 - 1330\n                                = -530\n\nAnswer: The final answer is -530.",

Now, we need to add up all these costs: brokerage fee + transfer fee plus the original cost of buying the property.\n   Total Cost = Selling Price + Brokerage Fee + Transfer Fee\n             = $390000 + $23400 + $54600 \n             = $471000\n\n4. Finally, we subtract Ms. Johnson's budget from this total cost to find out how much more it costs.\n   Cost Over Budget = Total Cost - Ms. Johnson's budget\n                   =  $471000 - $420000 \n                   = $51000\n\nAnswer: The final answer is $51,000",

So, \\( \\frac{30}{3} = 10\\) days.\n\nFor Sofia:\n- Similarly, we divide the total number of pieces by the amount she consumes each day.

Calculate how much money Yusuf earns in a week: \n    Total number of collections Ã— amount paid for each apartment collection\n= (number of complexes x total apartments /week)Ã— â‚£0.4\n\nPutting it all together:\nTotal earnings = 5 * ((6*400 +720)/3)*0.4\n               = 5*(1920/3)*0.4  \n               = 3840*0.4 \n               â‰ˆ â‚£15,360\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 15360",

So we can write an equation for x as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Purple} = \\frac{\\text{x}}{1 + 2\\%\\times(1+6)} \\]\n\nSince the number of purple cards must be equal to or less than x, and since there are no more red cards mentioned besides the sum of all other colors, we can write this equation as:\n\n\\[ 30 = \\frac{\\text{x}}{1 + 2\\%\\times(1+6)} \\]\n\nNext, let's solve for x.

Since there are 18 more cards than what is already accounted for:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total} = x\\times3 + y \\]\n\nSince the question doesn't mention anything about yellow card, it implies that all other types of cards (purple and red) sum up directly without any additional information regarding them.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 480.",

      "raw": "\nStep by step reasoning: \n1. First, we need to find the total weight of the SUV and its occupants.\n2. The weight of the furniture is 275 kilograms.\n3. Each young teammate weighs 75 kg, so for three teammates it would be \\(75 \\times 3 = 225\\) kg in addition to Gabriel's weight (which we don't know yet).\n4. Letâ€™s denote Gabriel's own bodyweight as Gkg.\n\nNow letâ€™s find the total mass of everything inside:\n\\[1700\\,kgs + 275\\,kgs + 225\\,kgs = 2200\\,kgs \\text{ (total weight)}.\\]\n\nStep by step reasoning: \nNext we need to calculate Gabriel's bodyweight Gkg.\nSince the force needed is only a percentage of total mass and not per individual:\n\\[F_{G} = F_{Total}\\%.\\]\nBut since \\(1700\\,kgs\\) includes his own weight (letâ€™s denote as 285 kg for simplicity), we can use it directly to find G.\nAssume Gabriel's bodyweight is equal or less than the total mass of furniture and teammates. So:\n\\[F_{G} = \\frac{1700\\,kgs}{3}\\approx566.67\\text{kgs (assuming he doesn't exceed 285 kg)}.\\]\n\nNow we can calculate F_total as a percentage of the total mass.\nGiven that \\(Force_{Total} = Force_{G} + \\frac{190%}{kgs}=F_{total}\\%\\):\n\\[1700\\, kgs * (3+ 4.5)=2200kg.\\]\nSince force is directly proportional to the total weight:\n\\[F_{Total} = F_{G}* \\text{(ratio of actual bodyweight)}=F_{g}* (\\frac{total mass}{actual bodymass}). \nAnswer: The final answer is approximately \\(1794.5\\,kgs.\\)",

According to the problem statement, this is \"1 pounds less than twice\" what a llama requires:\n   2 * (amount needed for one llama) - 1 = amount needed for one alpaca\nSince it's given that an alpaca needs only 1 pound less than double of the llama requirement,\nwe can express it as: \nalpacas need to be calculated based on llamas' hay requirements, and then we multiply by 36.\nNow letâ€™s calculate how much each type requires:\n- Each llama has a base requirement for hay (which is given directly at 10 pounds)\n- The alpaca's demand needs doubling of this amount after subtracting the one pound difference.\n\nFinally, multiplying these totals together will give us our answer: \n   total need = llamas' total * alpacas' per llama\n\nAnswer: To solve for the number we have:\nTotal hay required by llamas is 10 pounds each times 13.\nThen to find out how much more needed as a result of doubling and subtracting one pound, it's (2*llama amount) -1. \nFinally multiply this value into alpacas' total requirement: \n\nTherefore,\n   Total hay required for llamas is 10 pounds * 13\nAnd then add the same to find out how much more needed as a result of doubling and subtracting one pound:\nTotal = (2*llama amount) -1.\nMultiply this by alpacas' total requirement:\n\nSo, putting all these together in calculations will give us: \n\nTherefore,\n   Total hay required for llamas is 10 pounds * 13\nAnd then add the same to find out how much more needed as a result of doubling and subtracting one pound:\nTotal = (2*llama amount) -1.\nMultiply this by alpacas' total requirement:\n\nThus, the final answer: \n\nThe calculation results in an output of **475 pounds**.",

The first trout weighs 70 kilograms, the second weighs 33 kilograms, and the last one we don't know yet (let's call it x).\n3. We need to find out how much each of these weights add up to when multiplied by â‚¬1 per kilogram.\n\nAnswer: To calculate this, letâ€™s sum all the troutsâ€™ weight in kilograms:\n\n70 + 33 + x\n\nThen multiply that total by â‚¬1/kg which will give us his earnings. We can solve for \\(x\\) using any of the three weights if we know what each weighs or use a system to find out how many he caught and their respective costs.\n\nSince I don't have enough information about weight distribution, let's assume x = 32 kg (which means all other trouts weigh less than that) because it is common practice in such problems. We will now calculate his total earnings:\n\n70 + 33 + 32 * â‚¬1/kg\n\nLetâ€™s perform the calculation.\n\\(70+33+(32*â‚¬1)\\)\n\\(103+(\\text{total of other trouts} \\times \\$\\frac{1}{kg}\\))\n\nTo get a precise answer, I need to know how many kilograms each trout weighs.

Since skipping at a rate of two-fifths as fast as she can run means that running is faster than skipping but not twice as much, let's denote her running speed as R and her walking speed as W.\nWe know that:\nR = 4 * (2/5) = 16/5 miles per hour\nW = ??\n\nSince Tara runs two times faster than she can walk,\nwe have: \nR = 2*W\n\nSubstituting the value of R we found, we get:\n\n16/5 = 2*W => W = (16/5) / 2 = 8/5 miles per hour \n\nNow Tara spends two-fourths time running and one-half walking.\nTime spent in each activity is:\nRunning: T_running = total_time * (2/4)\nWalking: T_walking = total_time * (1/2)\n\nSubstituting the values for W, R we can calculate these times:\n\nT_running = 8 hours* (2/4) \n            = 6 hours\nT_walking = 8 hour*(1/2) \n\nTime spent in each activity is now known.

Calculate the total number of days Leon will eat at a higher rate for these 2 full periods plus some leftover time from one period (since we have 46/5 = 9 remainder):\n   \\( \\text{Extra Days} = 1 + \\frac{3}{5}\\) \n\n8. Total eggs needed:\n    - Eggs consumed in the first set: **\\(4\\)\n    - Additional days at higher rate: \n       (Since he eats for a full day with increased intake, and it's not possible to eat part of that extra period fully without additional math or assumptions about how much less than 108 is eaten)\n\nTherefore:\n   \\( \\text{Total Eggs} = 4 + \\frac{(6 -2) * (\\frac {3}{5}) }{\\frac{7}{6}}\\)\n\n9. Simplifying the above expression and adding up, we get a total of **\\(6\\) dozens**.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is **6**",
