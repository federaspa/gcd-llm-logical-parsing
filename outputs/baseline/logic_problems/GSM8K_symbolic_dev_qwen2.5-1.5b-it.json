Substituting in our value for the number of tennis balls we calculated earlier gives us:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Brown Tennis Balls} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 88\n   \\]\n\n5. Performing this final calculation, we get:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Brown Tennis Balls} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 88 = 44 \n    \\]\nAnswer: The final answer is 44 brown tennis balls.",

Similarly, since she walks at two times her speed on sidewalk,\n     we can say that it would take (13 miles / ((2v)*minutes))\n      = 7 hours or 420 minutes.\n\nTotal time taken for the entire walk is:\n   total_time= beach_walk + sidewalk_walk\n       =(5+420) = 425 min\n\nAnswer: The final answer is \nThe solution to this question indicates that it takes Fatima a total of **425** minutes to complete her daily walking on both parts.",

Total time taken for the whole walk is sum of beach and other parts, \n       which gives us: \\(T_{total} = T_{beach} + Time_{sidewalk}\n             = 48+0.5=48.5 \\) hours.\n  \nAnswer: The final answer is 48.5",

Since there are two such episodes per day:\nTotal for Sundays & Mondays = 2 * 4 hours\n\nNext, we'll add up all his other daily television viewing times:\n- Tuesday: He watched some unknown number (let's call this N) of shows that lasted 15 minutes each.\n- Wednesday: He finished homework early and watched a 4-hour episode followed by a 45-minute show. That totals to an additional 8 hours, or 4 * 60 minutes = 240 minutes.\n- Thursday: On Thursdays he stayed up late watching two episodes that lasted for three hours each. This adds another 3 hour x (1/2) day = 90 more minutes.\n\nNow we know the total time spent on these other days:\nTotal + Wednesday's additional shows and Thursday night viewing\n= Total Sundays & Mondays + Tuesday unknowns + Wednesday's unknown plus Thursday's long show\n\nGiven that Luca watched a total of 19 hours, let's calculate what he had already accounted for with his Sunday/Monday episodes.\nLet S be the number of minutes in an hour. We know:\n4 * (2) = 8 hours\nTotal time on Sundays & Mondays: 8S + N*15\n\nNow we can set up our equation to solve for N:\n\n(8S + N*15) + Total Wednesday and Thursday shows plus Saturday's unknowns \n= Total of all days including the ones not yet accounted, which is:\n240 (from Tuesday)\n90 minutes from Thursday\n3 * 60 = 180 total hours\n\nNow we sum these up:\n\n(8S + N*15) + [Total Wednesday and Thursday shows plus Saturday's unknowns]\n= Sums all days including the ones not yet accounted, which is:\n240 (from Tuesday)\n90 minutes from Thursday\n3 * 60 = 180 total hours\n\nThe sum of our known values on other weekdays should be equal to what we know Luca spent watching in total.

First, we need to determine how many items of each type Quinn will make for her 3 grandchildren.\n   - Vests: 7\n   - Cardigans: 7 (since they are triplets)\n   - Beanie hats: 7\n   - Gloves: Since gloves come in pairs and there's no information about individual ones, we'll assume it’s just one type of glove for each grandchild. So that would be 3.\n   - Booties: As with the gloves, booties are also paired so again assuming only one pair per child means another 3.\n\n2. Now let’s sum these up:\n   Total number items = Vests + Cardigans + Beanie hats + Gloves (paired) + Boots\n                        = 7+7+7+6*1/2+8*(2)\n\n            Here, we divided by two for gloves since they come in pairs and multiplied the number of boots per child with it as each pair would be same.\n\n3. Calculating total items:\n   Vest: 7 \n   Cardigan: 7\n   Beanie hat (per grandchild): 1/2 = 0.5, but we only need whole hats so this is zero.\n   Gloves (paired per child) : 6*1/2=3\n\n4.

Finally, we subtract Ms. Johnson's budget from this total cost to find out how much more it costs.\n   Cost Over Budget = Total Cost - Ms. Johnson's budget\n                   =  $471000 - $420000 \n                   = $51000\n\nAnswer: The final answer is $51,000",

So, \\( \\frac{30}{3} = 10\\) days.\n\nFor Sofia:\n- Similarly, we divide the total number of pieces by the amount she consumes each day.

So with the titanium pickaxe he can mine \\(10\\) kgs of ore per day.\n5. Now we need to calculate how much one troll mines in a month (29 days):\n   \\[\n   10 * 29 = 290\\text{ kg}\n   \\]\n6. To find out how many trolls can mine \\(290\\) kgs of ore, simply divide the total amount by the number of trolls:\n   \nAnswer: The final answer is **290**",

      "raw": "\nStep by step reasoning: \n1. First, we need to calculate the total hours worked in a week.\n   Umar works 9-hour shifts each day for 5 days a week.\n   Total weekly hours = 9 * 5 = 45 hours\n\n2. Next, let's find out how much he earns from his hourly wage alone:\n   Hourly earnings per hour = ₣25\n   Weekly earnings without bonus = 45 hours * $25/hour = $1,125\n\n3. Now we add the weekly bonus to calculate total monthly income if the company performed well for all months.\n   Weekly bonus amount = ₣552\n   Monthly income with bonus = Total weekly earnings + Weekly bonus\n                        = $1,125 + $552 = $1,677\n\n4. Finally, we multiply this total monthly figure by the number of weeks in June to get his total income for that month:\n   Number of days Umar works each week (assuming 30 or more working days)\n                        = 9 hours/day * 30 days/week\n                         ≈ 270 hours/month\n\n5.

So we can write an equation for x as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Purple} = \\frac{\\text{x}}{1 + 2\\%\\times(1+6)} \\]\n\nSince the number of purple cards must be equal to or less than x, and since there are no more red cards mentioned besides the sum of all other colors, we can write this equation as:\n\n\\[ 30 = \\frac{\\text{x}}{1 + 2\\%\\times(1+6)} \\]\n\nNext, let's solve for x. We do so by multiplying both sides with \\( (1 + 2\\%\\times7) \\):\n\n\\[ x = 30\\times(1 + 2\\%\\times7) \\]\n\nThen we divide the result by 8% to find out what x is:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{30}{6}\\]\n\nNow, since there are three times as many red cards than purple ones, and knowing that each set of scientist's card consists only of one color type (purple or yellow), then for every two colors we have a total number of 48 cards. We can find out how much more this is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Red} = x\\times3 \\]\n\nFinally, since the sum of all mentioned types of cards must be equal to three times as many red ones plus purple and yellow together (which adds up to \\(x + y\\)), we add them to get our total count. Since there are 18 more cards than what is already accounted for:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total} = x\\times3 + y \\]\n\nSince the question doesn't mention anything about yellow card, it implies that all other types of cards (purple and red) sum up directly without any additional information regarding them.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 480.",

According to the problem statement, this is \"1 pounds less than twice\" what a llama requires:\n   2 * (amount needed for one llama) - 1 = amount needed for one alpaca\nSince it's given that an alpaca needs only 1 pound less than double of the llama requirement,\nwe can express it as: \nalpacas need to be calculated based on llamas' hay requirements, and then we multiply by 36.\nNow let’s calculate how much each type requires:\n- Each llama has a base requirement for hay (which is given directly at 10 pounds)\n- The alpaca's demand needs doubling of this amount after subtracting the one pound difference.\n\nFinally, multiplying these totals together will give us our answer: \n   total need = llamas' total * alpacas' per llama\n\nAnswer: To solve for the number we have:\nTotal hay required by llamas is 10 pounds each times 13.\nThen to find out how much more needed as a result of doubling and subtracting one pound, it's (2*llama amount) -1. \nFinally multiply this value into alpacas' total requirement: \n\nTherefore,\n   Total hay required for llamas is 10 pounds * 13\nAnd then add the same to find out how much more needed as a result of doubling and subtracting one pound:\nTotal = (2*llama amount) -1.\nMultiply this by alpacas' total requirement:\n\nSo, putting all these together in calculations will give us: \n\nTherefore,\n   Total hay required for llamas is 10 pounds * 13\nAnd then add the same to find out how much more needed as a result of doubling and subtracting one pound:\nTotal = (2*llama amount) -1.\nMultiply this by alpacas' total requirement:\n\nThus, the final answer: \n\nThe calculation results in an output of **475 pounds**.",

First, let's find out how much each cow needs in kilograms.\n   - Each goat needs 8 kg of hay.\n   - Twice the amount a goat needs is \\(2 \\times 8 = 16\\) kg for one goat.\n   - The problem states that cows need \"8 kg less than twice\" what goats need, so it should be:\n     Cows: \\(16 - 8\\)\n       But this doesn't make sense since we have to subtract from the original amount each cow needs. So let's rephrase correctly:\n\n2. Each goat needs 8 kilograms.\n3. Twice that for a cow is then 8 \\(\\times\\) 2 = 16 kg, and it says cows need \"less\" than this:\n   - The actual calculation should be: Cows: \\(2 \\cdot (8) - 8\\)\n\n4.

Solving these equations gives us: \n      X=43+sqrt(59)\nStep by step reasoning ends here.\nAnswer: The final answer is 60",

According to the problem, Viktor’s grandfather was 32 years old at that time (G = 32).\n3. Viktor saw the comet a second time three times his own current age plus his grandfather's original age: \n   Second seeing time = Current Age * 3 + G\n4. Since we know that he saw it for the first time when he was younger than this, let’s denote the year of Viktor’s birth as B and his current age (let's call it C) years after his grandfather died.\n5. From step 2: Grandfather's original age = Victor's current age * 3 + G\n6. We know that G is 32 from earlier steps, so we can write:\n   G = 184 -> 1970 - B (grandfather’s birth year)\n7. Let Viktor be X years old when he saw the comet for first time.\n8. His grandfather's age at his death would have been: Grandfather died in 2053, so it was 61+X = Victor's current age * 3 + G\n9.

To find out how much money he spent on cookies (8% of his total amount):\n   Money spent on cookies = 0.08 * ¥700 \n                            ≈ ¥56\n\n4. Each cookie costs ¥50:\n   Number of cookies purchased by Viktor = ¥56 / ¥50\n ≈ 1.12 \n\nSince we cannot buy a fraction of a cookie, this means he bought exactly one whole cookie.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 1.",

First, we need to calculate the total amount Nia spent on buying 16 shares of stock at €75 each.\n   Total cost = Number of shares × Price per share  \n              = 16 × €75 = €1200\n   \n2. The first year sees a price increase by 30%. We can calculate this new price as follows:\n    New price after the first year = Original price + (Original price * Increase percentage)\n                                = €75 + (€75 × 0.3)  \n                                = €75 + €22.5\n                                = €97.5\n\n3. The second year, there's a decrease of 5% in the stock price.\n    New price after the second year = Price at first year - (Price at first year * Decrease percentage)\n                                 = €97.5 - (€97.5 × 0.05) \n                                 = €97.5 – €4.875\n                                 = €92.625\n\nTherefore, the final value of all Nia's shares is:\n\nAnswer: The final answer is €92.625",
