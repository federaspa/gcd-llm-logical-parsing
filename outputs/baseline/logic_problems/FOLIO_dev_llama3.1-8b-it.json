From the premises, we have two main possibilities for Bonnie:\n   - Either she attends and is very engaged with school events (and thus a student who attends the school), or\n   - She neither attends nor is very engaged with school events.\n\n2. We know that if people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events.\n3. However, we don't have direct information about Bonnie performing in school talent shows from any of the premises.\n4. To conclude whether or not she performs in school talent shows often based on her engagement status alone isn’t possible because there's no given link between being a student who attends and is engaged with events to performing at talent shows.\n\n5. However, we can deduce information about Bonnie through other means: \n   - If the first possibility (she attends and engages) holds true then she performs often in school talent shows.\n   \n6. We have another part of our premises saying that people either perform or are inactive; this is irrelevant to determining if someone is a student.\n\n7. Now let’s use information from other parts:\n- The 3rd premise says, “If people chaperone high school dances then they’re not students who attend the school,” but it doesn’t tell us anything about Bonnie being either active or disinterested.\n   - It only tells us that if she is involved with something else (chaperoning), this might make her a student.\n\n8. Using information in premises 4 and 5, we can see people are inactive if they chaperone but since it says all who are inactive chaperone high school dances then there isn’t enough evidence from these parts to conclude whether or not Bonnie is active because she could still be a student (she’s engaged with events).\n\n9. Now the last premise:\n   - It tells us that people either perform at talent shows often, which would make them very engaged and attending; \n     - Or they are inactive members of their community.\n10. Then we know from premise 5: “All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers...” then this implies Bonnie is a student.\n\n11. From all premises combined:\n    * We have two possibilities for Bonnie (she either attends/engages or she does not) \n      - This leaves us with the conclusion that since we cannot prove from these statements alone whether or not she performs in talent shows, our only option left to conclude anything about her performance status is if it’s possible to determine how likely one of those two possibilities must be given all premises.\n\n12. It can't tell you definitively which path Bonnie takes and so the truth value depends on this uncertainty.",

From premise 4 and premise 6 we can conclude that:\n    If people are inactive and disinterested members of their community (and therefore chaperone high school dances), then they either attend and engage in school events or not, but it doesn't matter because from premise 3 if someone chaperones the dance they cannot be a student at the same time.\n\n3. From premises 5 and 6 we can conclude that Bonnie is definitely attending and engaged with school events (if she's one of these students) since being disengaged would contradict her also not being a student which contradicts premise 4 about inactive community members, chaperoning dances.\n\n4. Given the conclusion statement: \n    - We are trying to prove:\n      \"If Bonnie is either both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities AND (chaperones high school dances OR neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities) then Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or an inactive and disinterested member of their community\"\n\n    - Premise 5 states that students wishing to further their education are indeed attending, as well as premise 6 about how there are only two options for Bonnie.\n    \n   Using these facts we can say: If she's one type (wishing to pursue higher ed), then the 'and' is actually a conditional here - since it says if they wish and also chaperone dances OR not wishing, this means that all cases of her either doing so or not are covered by being students attending school in premise 5. \n\n   Hence we can conclude: \n    If Bonnie is either both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career AND (chaperones high school dances OR neither) then she must be one type which would mean that the 'or' statement after \"OR\" does not apply and therefore she will indeed be an attending student from premise 5.\n\n   However we need to look at the case of Bonnie being a non-student inactive member.\n   \n    - Since there is no other information stating otherwise, if someone chaperones dances they are by definition (from premises) either disengaged or not students. Therefore she could indeed be an inactive member since premise 6 gives us two options and we have established that the first option for her being a student doesn't apply here.\n\n5. Since these conclusions hold true under all circumstances described in the conclusion statement, it is safe to say:\n\nThe final answer is A) True",

Let's analyze the conclusion: If Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often, then Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n\nFrom premise 2: People either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community. \nSo we can say that if she performs in school talent shows, then Bonnie is an inactive and disinterested member of her community (from this statement).\n\nNow let's consider both possibilities mentioned in the conclusion:\n- If Bonnie chaperones high school dances: From premise 4, all people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances. Therefore, if she does not perform in talent shows often but instead is an active member (which contradicts), then this scenario fails as it cannot be that a person both chaperones the dance and attends events.\n\n- If Bonnie doesn't chaperone high school dances: Then from premise 4, we know that people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community must participate in such activities. Given that she either performs often or does not (as per conclusion's conditional), then performing is a scenario where the statement holds as stated.\n\n2. Combining information:\n- If Bonnie doesn't chaperone high school dances: Then from premise 4, we know people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community participate in such activities.\n   From step one (in this case considering that she does not perform), if she indeed participates then the first part is met. \n   And since performing in talent shows makes her an inactive member as per premises two and four combined with conclusion's premise, it follows.\n\n- If Bonnie chaperones high school dances: As mentioned before from step one of this reasoning process that contradicts because a person can't be active and disinterested at the same time.\n   However since we have to follow given rules for our statement then when considering all other premises they do not directly negate her status as inactive. \n    Instead, chaperoning high school dances (from premise 4) is associated with being an inactive member of community which follows from information provided.\n\n3. Analyze Bonnie's involvement in academic career:\n- All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.\n   This statement doesn't provide direct relationship between her status as a student or not, but since chaperoning is associated with being inactive which has no relation (as per premise 4) we need more information about this.\n\n- Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school.\n   This statement doesn't provide direct relationship between her status as an inactive member of community but we can analyze from above steps.\n\n4. Analyzing both premises together:\n- If Bonnie performs in talent shows: As per premise 2, she becomes an inactive and disinterested member (from this statement), which is also mentioned in the conclusion.\n   Also since performing makes someone a disengaged individual as stated before it aligns with given rules for our scenario.\n\nFrom all steps combined we have information about her status that can be categorized under both conditions of the premise:\n- Performing: This does not contradict any part and from step one shows she is indeed inactive. \n  Since being active contradicts this statement then chaperoning isn't considered in this case but it also aligns with conclusion's condition as an inactive member.\n\nConsidering all possibilities we can say that Bonnie performs either way if given a conditional of the premise - whether performing or not, both will result her status to be classified under conditions provided.\nTherefore she indeed falls into categories mentioned for our final scenario.\n\n\nAnswer: The final answer is A).",

We also know from the premise that \"An animal is either a rabbit or a squirrel.\" However, this does not provide any information about turtles yet; it only gives us two categories: rabbit and squirrel.\n\n3. The next statement says that \"All squirrels are skittish,\" which links the property of being a squirrel with another characteristic – being skittish.\n\n4. Since we know from earlier premises that animals can either be rabbits or squirrels, but not both (from an animal is either a rabbit or a squirrel), and given all squirrels are skittish; this implies no squirrels will also fit the first premise of 'All rabbits are cute'.\n\n5. Given \"If something is skittish, then it's not still\" – we can conclude that since squirrels (which include animals other than rabbits) cannot be both still and skittish at once due to their skittish nature; Rock being described as \"still,\" means rock must NOT fit the definition of a squirrel.\n\n6. We know from the premises, an animal is either a rabbit or a squirrel but since we have concluded that 'Rock' can't possibly be one because it's still and not skittish (given its description), this implies Rock does not belong to those two categories: rabbits and squirrels.\n\n7. Although there are turtles existing as per the premises, nothing directly links any characteristic of rock with being a turtle or cute; we only know that all animals can be classified into either rabbit/squirrel groups due to given information about them in other premises but this doesn't apply here because 'Rock' was found not part of those categories.\n\n8. Since there's no direct connection made between Rock and any characteristic (like turtles) which could have helped us conclude what it is; the only logical inference we can make with respect to its categorization as per information given in premises is that rock cannot be classified under rabbit/squirrel group because of being \"still.\"\n\n9. However, 'Rock' doesn't fall into these two categories: rabbits and squirrels due to our earlier conclusion.\n\n10. Although there's no direct link between Rock and the category turtles; from all available premises – we can say nothing conclusively about rock belonging or not belonging to that group either as per this information alone because its description does NOT help classify it in any way with respect to turtle (given one premise only mentioned they 'exist'). \n\n11. We are told, \"All rabbits are cute.\" However since we concluded earlier Rock falls into none of the two categories: rabbit or squirrel due to being still and not skittish; given no further information about its categorization in other premises - all that is left for us now would be considering what premise does tell about a potential characteristic it could possess which makes 'Rock' fit. \n\n12. Considering our earlier deduction where Rock was found not fitting rabbit/squirrel group because of being \"still\" (given their respective properties), we were unable to classify rock based on those categories; but from premises, there is another category mentioned: turtles.\n\n13. However the premise does state that all rabbits are cute - and given 'All animals' must either be classified as a rabbit or squirrel due to premises which doesn't include any characteristics of Rock like being skittish (which would not match its description) OR still; this implies rock might potentially fit another category since it can also NOT belong in those two categories.\n\n14. Given the premise \"Rock is still\" - there's no further information that links a potential categorization for 'rock' with properties of turtles from given premises alone so far, we're left to make an inference based on what was provided; and if rock has some characteristic which makes it cute then our conclusion could be supported.\n\n15. Given the premise \"All rabbits are cute,\" this tells us that all animals classified as a rabbit must also have 'cute' property attached with them - so given we found out earlier Rock does NOT belong to those categories (rabbit/squirrel) because of being still and not skittish; if rock's only characteristic mentioned is it's \"still\" then the information about rabbits would be useful in classifying its categorization.\n\n16. Now since 'Rock' has no other characteristics than that described from premises - given we are told all animals fall into either rabbit or squirrel categories but can't fit there because of being still; if Rock doesn’t belong to those two categories (rabbit/squirrel), the information provided about rabbits will be useful in making an inference.\n\n17. We know 'All rabbits' have a certain property attached with them: \"cute\" - however rock falls into none of these groups, so this characteristic might make it fit another category which could also potentially classify its characteristics since we found out earlier that Rock doesn’t belong to those two categories due to being still.\n\n18.

This tells us about the existence of turtles but does not provide any additional information relevant to Rock's classification or its characteristics (cute or skittish).\n\n3. Another premise states \"An animal is either a rabbit or a squirrel.\" While this statement gives conditions under which an animal can be classified, it doesn't help with determining whether something is cute or skittish.\n\n4. The next premise tells us that if something is skittish then it's not still (\"If something is skittish, then it is not still\"). This information implies the opposite of being still (movement) and thus indirectly relates to an animal's behavior but we can't conclude from this whether Rock is cute or a turtle/squirrel.\n\n5. The fifth premise says that \"All squirrels are skittish.\" Since squirrels cannot be both non-skittish (as per step 4) and all of them being skittish, they must not still according to the definition in the premises. \n\n6. Lastly, we know from a premise that Rock is still (\"Rock is still\"). This directly contradicts information given by steps 5.\n\n7.

In turn because of step 4 and our knowledge from premises about what animals are still or non-still we can deduce whether it's cute.\n\n8. We have Rock being a squirrel which means it must be skittish (as per premise where all squirrels ARE skittish).

From premises: \"An animal is either a rabbit or a squirrel.\" This tells us that any given animal must fall under one of these two categories.\n\n4.

The only remaining possibility based on given premises, is Rock must not fall under either category of rabbit or squirrel (from the premise: An animal is either a rabbit or a squirrel), which contradicts our initial interpretation in step 3 but allows us to explore another path that may help with the conclusion directly stated as \"If Rock is cute and still...\"\n\n6.

Since we do not know if Karen will download or share 'Stranger Things', and as per premise: If Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will share it to Lisa (which was established in step 2 that Karen does indeed watch), the only way for us to infer whether she shares \"Stranger Things\" is by first understanding her behavior based on all information given. \n8. Given our previous observations of how popularity affects downloading and then sharing a show, we can conclude: If Karen binge-watches 'Stranger things' (which was established in step 2), the premise tells us that she will share it to Lisa.\n9. Therefore, since we have confirmed her behavior pattern for watching popular shows (\"strange Things\") being shared if they are watched and knowing from earlier steps that popularity alone isn't a reason why 'Stranger things' would be downloaded (thus no contradiction in sharing based on the premises), our answer will reflect this understanding.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is A) True",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. From the premises, we know \"Stranger Things\" is a popular Netflix show.\n2. We also have a conditional statement: If a Netflix show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it. However, this premise alone does not imply that Stranger Things' popularity means any other specific shows are popular.\n\n3. Another key piece of information from the premises states that if and only if Karen binge-watches a Netflix show (let's call it X), she will download it (X). This indicates an exclusive relationship between binge-watching and downloading, meaning that for every X, there cannot be another Y such that both Y is downloaded by Karen when she does not watch Y.\n\n4. We also have the information: \"Black Mirror\" is a Netflix show.\n5. Since we know from premise 2 that if and only if Karen binge-watches a Netflix show (let's call it X), then she will download X, this implies there are no other conditions under which someone can be downloaded by her.\n\n6. From the premises: If Karen does not download \"Black Mirror\", given Black mirror is indeed on netflix; we must consider its popularity or lack thereof separately from Stranger Things' because they each have a unique set of implications.\n7. The premise also states that if and only if she binge-watches any Netflix show, then it will be downloaded by her (meaning no other shows can meet this condition as per point 3).\n\n8. However, there is one additional piece of information: If Karen binge-watches a netflix show X, the conclusion that follows from premise number five; implies she will share X with Lisa.\n\n9. Using all these premises and steps in mind we have to make an evaluation regarding \"Black Mirror\" being popular or not.\n \n10. Since there are no specific statements saying Black mirror is popular and given our deductions above - The only way for Karen to download any netflix show (like black mirror), would be if she binge-watched it, however; as per the premises this also means that other shows cannot meet these conditions.\n\n11. It can thus be inferred from premise 6 and steps made in point number 7 regarding her downloading habits: Since Black Mirror does not have any of its own unique statements or implications outside those general rules - Karen's lack of action towards \"Black mirror\" could very well indicate that she either has no interest, hasn't binge-watched it (hence cannot share with Lisa), and as a result; is unable to download the show.\n\n12. Thus from points 6-11 we can infer Black Mirror’s popularity based on premise number one in relation to the other conditions set forth by all premises provided: If she has no interest, hasn't watched it - there's also another statement which if true would prove black mirror isn’t popular (premise stating Karen will binge-watch a show only when that specific condition is met for her).\n\n13. So putting all these steps and inferences together we can safely say Black Mirror’s popularity status should be considered as unknown due to lack of information from premises regarding any unique conditions which could make it more or less popular than Stranger Things.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is C",

We can conclude from the previous step that for any given popular Netflix show, either Karen doesn't watch it or downloads it; however this alone isn’t sufficient to determine what happens with \"Black Mirror\".\n5. Given premise 6 (\"Black Mirror\" is a Netflix show), we know that \"Black Mirror\" fits our first condition (popular and on netflix).\n6. However from the premises, there's no direct link between Karen watching \"Stranger Things\" or any other popular shows to her actions with \"Black Mirror\".\n7. From premise 4 (\"If and only if Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will download it\"), we can conclude that for 'any' given netflix show (not limited to the ones mentioned), either you watch and then download; or don’t do anything.\n8. We're told in premise 7, \"Karen does not download 'Black Mirror'\", so from steps 3 & 6 we know she must have not binge-watched it because if only one of those conditions isn't met (either downloading the show after watching), and since this is a two-way statement ('if' or 'only'), then for there to be no action at all, Karen can’t watch \"Black Mirror\" either.\n9. Given premise 8 (\"If Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will share it to Lisa\"), we now have our required information: the only way that this could affect what happens with \"Black Mirror\", is if and when 'it' gets watched by her (and subsequently downloaded), but in step 7 & 6 we concluded there was no watching of Black Mirror.\n10.

To deduce whether or not Marvin can be a human, let's examine the given premises more closely:\n   - Since everyone on Earth is human (premise 4), but Marvin cannot be both from Earth and Mars (premise 5).\n   \n4. Now to analyze if Marvin could possibly be an extraterrestrial who isn't from Earth or Mars: \n   Given that all aliens are extraterrestrial, it follows logically then the only other way for someone not on either of those two places is indeed alien.\n    \nHowever we must also check and see whether this condition can overlap with being a human at any point in time.\n\n5.

Djokovic being famous and an athlete implies he's well paid, as per the transitive property from premises 'If a person is an athlete then they are famous.' to  'All professional tennis players are athletes.'\n4. Since we have information that if someone lives in tax havens (as all well-paid people do), it can be deduced that djokivic's living location implies he might live somewhere else or there isn't enough evidence for his specific case, but since the premises say \"all\" and Djokovic is a professional tennis player we know this part of premise 4 has truth in relation to Djokvic.\n5. However, considering all the information given about djokivic being famous and well-paid from steps above there isn't enough evidence that directly states he's an Oscar-nominated actor or just a grand slam champion - it only shows his living conditions might be related if we assume those premises were applied in reverse (well paid -> lives somewhere else).\n6.

Given this new premise if Djokovic's living location implies he might be a Grand Slam champion - since we know from step 4 of our previous reasoning, that \"all well-paid people\" (from which djokivic being an athlete and therefore also famous makes him one) live in tax havens then it can't directly imply his occupation as per the information given.\n9. As such there isn't enough evidence to prove or disprove Djokovic's title of grand slam champion, but we know he is well paid (as an athlete).\n10.

We also have two separate chains to consider:\n   Chain A: \n      - All people who are Grand Slam champions are professional tennis players.\n      - All professional tennis players are athletes.\n      This chain does not provide any specific link that connects Djokovic's profession or status directly with being in a tax haven.\n\n3. Another chain is possible, but again we need to look at all the given statements:\n   Chain B: \n     Given premise 7 states \"If Djokovic is famous and an athlete then he lives well paid\" however it does not say if this leads him into living in a tax heaven as that would be another link of information which isn't present.\n\n4. However, we do have two other premises to consider:\n   Chain C: \n     - All people who are celebrities (and thus Oscar-nominated actors) are well-paid.\n     This chain still doesn’t give us any direct connection between Djokovic’s status and tax haven living as that's another link of information.\n\n5. Considering all the available links in this problem, we can see none of them directly connects \"Djokovic\" with being an Oscar-nominated actor or a Grand Slam champion but there is one statement left which has some potential for use:\n   - All well-paid people live in tax havens.\n \n6. We need to make the connection using Djokovic as our example, however from what we have been provided so far, it’s possible that he might be an athlete due to being a Grand Slam champion or Oscar-nominated actor but there isn’t enough information linking these two pieces of data.\n\n7. If we consider chain A (Grand slam -> Tennis player) then this makes him famous as per the statement “All professional tennis players are athletes” and also make them well paid if he is indeed an athlete due to another rule given in premises that states all people who are athletes, then they're famous.\n \n8. We can use our last premise which links being well-paid with living a tax haven.\n\n9. Thus we know Djokovic might be well-paid from the above two lines of reasoning (he's either an Oscar-nominated actor or Grand Slam champion and he is indeed both an athlete & possibly an Oscar nominated celebrity).\n\n10 Therefore, if this information about him being well paid can lead to one final piece of data which links \"well paid\" with living in a tax haven.\n\n11. So from premises we know that all people who are celebrities then they're well-paid (premise 4) but we also have another statement - Djokovic is famous and an athlete if he's indeed both these things, this makes him possibly Oscar-nominated actor or Grand Slam champion based on what has been given to us so far.\n\n12.

Therefore our task is now reduced to linking \"famous and athlete\" with living well-paid, but it's stated clearly as per premise 7 if this condition happens then we do have enough data.\n\n14. As Djokovic being famous and an athlete would indeed make him live in tax haven because that’s what the last two premises say about people who are either of those things.\n\n\n\nAnswer: The final answer is A",

Given these points, we can infer: \n    a) That there is no contradiction in saying either sex could be involved\n   - and b) Since all female players were ranked highly by WTA due to losing to Swiatek (point 2), this means that the condition for being among active tennis players applies equally well on both sexes.\n6. From point 1, if Coco Gauff is a player who lost to Rafael Nadal or someone else whom we can infer she might be ranked highly by WTA due to losing them as per Swiatek's opponents (point 2), then it would mean that Coco Gauff isn't male because the premise states that players being among active tennis participants will cover both sexes, but in this particular case point a) of our inference rules out such an interpretation. However, we still have another possibility to consider: \n    c) We can use information about what happens when someone is ranked highly by WTA and loses either Nadal or Iga Swiatek.\n7. Since Coco Gauff lost to Rafael Nadal (according to the conclusion), then if she had also been among those losing Iga, that would mean a different case in which her sex isn't male - however given we only have information about one loss here and since there's an 'or' condition with other possible opponents of hers for whom it might be true as per point 2 (due to Swiatek being ranked highly), then this must imply another reason: Coco Gauff is indeed among active tennis players at Roland Garros because losing Nadal falls under her being a female who lost either him or Iga, implying she meets the criteria of all participants there which also includes males. Therefore we see that point 2 combined with our previous points about both groups meeting this condition leads us to conclude Coco Gauff is indeed among active tennis players at Roland Garros due to losing Rafael Nadal.\n\nGiven these inferences and premises:\n\nThe conclusion can be broken down into the following steps: If you are a player who lost either Iga or someone else ranked highly, then your sex isn't male. Since this applies equally well on both sexes because of point 2 (all female players at Roland Garros were among most active due to losing Swiatek), we can conclude that if Coco Gauff is one such loser against Rafael Nadal in addition to another loss which could have been Iga or any other ranked highly, then she must not be male tennis player.\n\nHowever since the premises give an 'or' condition and all players who were active at Roland Garros either lost Swiatek (point 2) or didn't lose her. This implies that losing Rafael Nadal falls under this category because we don’t know what sex Coco Gauff is from our premises but can infer she could be any of these two categories of losers since it’s not explicitly mentioned which opponent's loss led us to classify a player as among most active at Roland Garros.\n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation should have been about losing Rafael Nadal because we see that point 2 says female players who lost Iga are also ranked highly by WTA. Since this is an 'or' condition it applies on both sexes and since Coco Gauff could be any of these two categories (either loser) due to premises not providing information which opponent's loss led us classify her sex, then the correct answer would have been different from what was concluded in step 7.\n\nFrom point a), we know that either female or male tennis players were at Roland Garros. Since all female tennis players lost Swiatek and are therefore ranked highly by WTA (as per points 1 & 2), this implies both groups of active participants meet the criteria for being among most active due to premises stating it’s an 'or' condition which applies on both sexes.\n\nHowever, we must consider point c): If Coco Gauff lost Rafael Nadal or another ranked highly opponent then she isn't male.

To determine if this conclusion is true, false, or unknown, let's examine each premise.\n\n3. Premise 1: If a player is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are among the most active players in major tennis.\n   - This premise provides information about being ranked high and its relation to activity level but does not directly impact Coco Gauff or her loss status yet.\n\n4. Premise 2: Everyone who lost to Iga Swiatek is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association.\n   - So, if a player was defeated by Iga at Roland Garros in '22 and got ranked high she could be an active one but that doesn’t tell us anything about Coco yet.\n\n5. Premise 3: All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Swiatek.\n   - This premise indicates every woman player played against Iga, implying they all might have been among the ranked high group as per Premise (1), but again this does not provide information about Coco Gauff.\n\n6. Premise 4: Either female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 or male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022.\n   - This premise is quite general and doesn’t have any direct relation to the conclusion we are trying to evaluate yet so let’s keep moving.\n\n7. Premise 5: All male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal.\n   - So, this implies that all males played against Rafa but still does not tell us anything about Coco or her loss status directly.\n\n8. Premise 6: If Coco Gauff is a player who is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or a player who lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.\n   - This premise sets up conditions for determining whether Coco could be one of those males playing against Rafa.\n\nNow let’s put this together:\n\nStep 9: To find if the conclusion about Coco holds true we should think as follows:\n- If she didn't lose to Iga then that would make her a player not among the ones ranked high by WTA (as per premise 2 and its relation with 3).\n- But, given premise 6 - this doesn’t tell us whether or not coco lost to rafa though it does provide information about what happens when coco meets certain conditions.\n\nStep 10: To determine if Coco is among the active ones in major tennis we need two pieces of info from premises:\n1. If she was a high ranked player (from premise 3 which also ties back into Premise 2).\nHowever, this can be countered by thinking that perhaps cocoguaff wasn't one to lose against Iga and if not then the only other condition left is being among those who lost against Rafa in '22.\n\nStep 11: However, as per premise (5) all of them males were defeated so coco wouldn’t have been a male playing against rafa at that time.\n\n\n\nGiven this reasoning process:\n\nThe final answer is A).",

We also know from the premises that all streaming services are digital.\n\n3. The conclusion states that 1984 is printed text, but to verify this statement, let's analyze the given information about hardcover books and streaming services. It is mentioned in the premise: \"If an object is a hardcover book then it is printed text.\"\n\n4. Now we look at another piece of information provided by one of our premises which states that if 1984 were to be classified as 'a' (note: variable used for demonstration only) streaming service, then it would have to also be considered 'b', where b = \"a hardcover book.\" Therefore this premise gives a conditional statement.\n\n5. To verify whether or not the conclusion is correct we need more information from our premises which states that 1984 being classified as an item of type (variable used for demonstration only) streaming service, would also make it equivalent to 'b', where b = \"a hardcover book.\" Therefore if we find a way to classify '1984' in terms of the given conditions provided by premise then this might lead us closer to our conclusion. \n\n6. Based on information from step 5 we have two premises that state an item (item used for demonstration only) is classified as streaming service it must also be considered \"hardcover book\". The other condition states if a certain thing were 'b' in the premise where b = \"a hardcover\" then this implies that its digital. This means we are essentially trying to prove whether 1984 falls under either of these categories.\n\n7. Given our premises, let's evaluate them one more time - specifically with reference to streaming services and their relation to being 'analog' or 'digital'. Since all streaming services must be considered as non-analogue this indicates that they are digital mediums (step 1). The other premise which we need in order for the final evaluation is \"If an object is a hardcover book then it is printed text.\"\n\n8. Combining steps 6 and 7 to evaluate our premises more clearly, from step 2 all streaming services must be considered 'digital', with reference back to premise one where no digital media are analog mediums we can now confidently conclude that any item classified as \"streaming service\" in the given context would also need to fall into category of being non-analog and therefore this particular group of items - in our case 1984 is indeed a streaming service. \n\n9. Given step number eight, if an object (item used for demonstration only) were considered 'a' hardcover book then it must be classified as printed text because we have information from premise which states that any item being \"b\" where b = 'hardcover' would also mean its equivalent to a \"printed text.\" Since our first step established the fact all streaming services are non-analog and thus digital, if 1984 is indeed an instance of such service then it can't be considered printed (this goes back to premise one). But we have another piece information that gives conditional statement which states in order for item 'c' where c = \"a hardcover book\" this would also mean its equivalent to a 'd', with d representing the term  \"1984 is streaming service\". The given premises state that if an object (item used for demonstration only) were considered 'b' or more precisely - a variable we'll call b in our example here where b = 'a hardcover book\" then this would mean it's equivalent to item classified as type c. In order to find out whether 1984 is printed text, the given information states if an object (item used for demonstration only) were considered \"b\", with variable we'll call b in our case equaling - a 'hardcore' book or more precisely stated within context of this example item that falls into category equivalent to being type d, where d = 1984 is streaming service. \n\n10. Combining steps number eight and nine now: From premise given if an object (item used for demonstration only) were considered \"b\", then it must be classified as printed text because we have information from premises which states that any item falling into category equivalent to being type b or more precisely stated within the context of this example - would also mean its equivalent to a 'c' where c = 1984 is streaming service. If an object were considered \"b\", it must be classified as printed text.\n\n11. Now let's look at another piece information given in premise which states that if item (item used for demonstration only) were considered type d, then this would also mean its equivalent to 'a'. From our previous step we know from the premises - all streaming services are digital mediums and no such medium can be analog.\n\n12. Based on steps 10-11: If an object is a hardcover book",

From the premises, we know that \"No digital media are analog\" and \"All streaming services are digital.\" We can infer from this that all streaming services cannot be analog.\n\n2. Since every printed text is analog (from the second premise), a hardcover book must also be an analog object because it is classified as a printed text in one of the premises.\n\n3. Now we examine if 1984 is a hardcover book: If \"If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book\" (the fourth premise), this would lead to two possible scenarios:\n    - Scenario A) We assume that 1984 being classified as both an analog and digital media at the same time makes no sense in our context since we've established all digital content can't be analog. However, considering if it's indeed a streaming service or hardcover book directly is not immediately clear from these premises alone because this statement only serves to inform us of 1984's status depending on whether \"If an object (in this case 'it') is a stream then [object] is also a HC\" holds true. However, we need the first part for our scenario.\n    - Scenario B) We take what was given and determine that if it indeed IS classified as both streaming service & hardcover book due to \"If an object (in this case 'it') is a stream then [object] is also a HC\", so 1984 being both can only be true because in our context we have not been informed otherwise. In other words, the first part of the fourth statement must hold for it's second clause.\n\nGiven that \"If an object (in this case 'it') is a stream then [object] is also a HC\", if 1984 being classified as both analog and digital in our context isn't possible because no content can be both at once, we instead examine the fact that all hardcover books are printed texts which means they're not streaming services (which are by definition 'digital'), so given what's been said about \"If an object is a hardcover book then it is printed text\" and our determination of 1984 being a HC if it were indeed classified as digital content, we can make the following deduction:\n- If all HC books cannot be analog because they're not digital in nature (from previous steps), but also from this scenario A) that would mean 'if an object IS streaming then [object] is ALSO hardcover book', meaning for our context here it must indeed follow that 1984 being a HC makes sense as well - given its status of possibly both at once depending on what was previously stated, the conclusion now falls apart. It should be noted we've made this determination with information provided by only the second to last statement.\n\nStep B) \nNow let's take all our previous findings and put them into context.\n- We established 1984 can't possibly have a status of analog since no content in our premise is classified as both at once (this being because \"No digital media are analog.\").\nHowever, we also know if it IS indeed a streaming service then 'it' would be considered hardcover book by the statement given to us and based on that alone.\nNow let's think about what was stated - If 1984 were classified as both an object type which can only exist digitally (streaming services) & analog, we've already established this cannot happen. However in our context of premises provided here 'If it is a stream then [object] is hardcover book', given that all HC books are indeed printed texts and thus not digital content but rather the opposite ('analog') - so if 1984 being classified as both streaming service & analog media at once cannot happen (since no content in our premise can be simultaneously digital/analog) we see a problem for what's been stated about 'If it is a stream then [object] is hardcover book'.\n- Since all HC books are printed texts which means they're not digital, this would mean the fourth statement holds true only if 1984 were indeed classified as both at once because in our context of premises provided here we cannot have content that can be analog and digital. However since no such possibility exists given 'No digital media are analog', it seems to us now more clearly why 1984 must not, then also must not be a hardcover book - this would mean for the fourth statement \"If an object is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book\" to hold true under our premise that all content cannot exist in two different forms at once. It follows now more clearly why if we have these premises and what was previously stated about no such possibility existing of 'No digital media are analog.'\n\n\nNow let's proceed with this last bit - If 1984 can indeed be classified as a hardcover book, then it would follow that the second part must hold (it being a streaming service), given our premise which states: \"If an",

Since we know in step 3, Ted is neither a domisticated nor a bovine then it can't be classified under the group where only some (pets) are considered as part of this broader category mentioned earlier (\"some pets\") based on premise 6; because that statement implies existence within \"cows\" - which we have already established in step 3, is not applicable to Ted. \n   But still from premise 2 and step 4 &5 , the fact remains: if something is a bovine it must be domesticated (premise 3).

From points above it's impossible for ted, who is described as being an alligator in one statement within this problem set to have any logical connection of him being both those categories (pet or cow).\n\n7. Since we can eliminate the possibility that Ted could be considered a pet due to our deduction and knowing he cannot fit into the domesticated category because no such animals are classified under it, there's also another important fact here: \"All cows are bovines\" in combination with the premise about being an aligator prevents us from connecting him directly or indirectly through that path of reasoning.\n\n8. Ted is identified as a pet and cow at conclusion which we've shown can't be true using points above since he cannot possibly meet both conditions under these premises.\n\n\n\nAnswer: The final answer is B) False",

This means if an animal is domesticated (or falls under any category of being considered as such), we can be certain it's not classified as an \"alligator.\"\n5. We're also given the information that 'Ted is a crocodile' is actually incorrect in our premises and Ted is instead stated to be an alligator.\n\nHowever, since none of these premises directly state whether or not any animals are domesticated alligators (which would allow us to rule out this possibility), we must proceed with caution. But given the information that no animal classified as being \"domestic\" can also be referred to as a 'alligator,' it seems Ted cannot fall into either category.\n6.

From the third premise, \"Some stocks of some companies are growth stocks of companies,\" we cannot conclude anything about any specific stock being volatile or suitable because 'some' means there could be exceptions and does not imply universality like in premise 1; however this statement is necessary to get a conclusion for KO as it's actually related directly with the final answer. \n\n4. The fourth premise says, \"All stocks of mature companies are suitable for a retirement fund.\" Since we know that all growth stocks are volatile (from step one), if any company were both a 'mature' and 'growth', then its stock would not be a good candidate as it's the type described in the first statement.\n\n5. The fifth premise states, \"KO is a stock of a mature company.\" This means we can conclude that KO must be suitable for retirement funds according to step 4 because all stocks from mature companies are considered suitable for this purpose.\n\n6. We now need to analyze if it's possible for KO to also fit the 'growth' category described in premise one (as volatile). From our previous steps, especially with premises three and five; we can deduce that KO is indeed a stock of some company as mentioned directly by premise 3 when paired up together.\n\n7. Combining information from step four about maturity stocks being suitable for retirement funds along with the fact it's a 'growth' (from first premise) or not, if volatile then unsuitable; we can form our final conclusion that says: \"If KO is a growth stock of a company or if its price is volatile, then KO is neither a stock of a company nor is its price volatile.\" This seems initially confusing given the premises about volatility and maturity. But here's what actually happens:\n\n- If it IS a 'growth' (volatile), THEN we know it doesn't fit as described in this particular conclusion; so our main target to prove or disprove would be if KO was not suitable for retirement funds, which is true based on premise 2.\n \nBut there are conditions mentioned here where indeed: \"If volatility means unsuitability then stock can never both be volatile AND part of a 'growth' group as per the first two premises. That implies our target statement in conclusion about being neither 'stock nor price-volatile', should not actually hold true since KO's actual status based on given information is that it IS indeed suitable for retirement funds.\n\nTherefore we have found out: volatility indirectly makes an investment unsuitable for a pension fund; however, the specific case of KO does NOT match this particular conclusion because its stock type (as described in premises) as a 'growth' category actually isn't accurate based on premise five about maturity stocks being good investments.",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. We start with the conclusion: \"Mary is not a picky eater and spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls.\"\n\n2. To determine if this is true, we need to break down the premises.\n\n3. Premise 5 directly states that if Mary works in student jobs on campus and needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.\n   However premise does not mention anything about enjoying dining hall meals or spending time eating with friends. Therefore this information alone cannot confirm the conclusion.\n\n4. We need more information from premises 1 and 2 which connect student jobs on campus, earning money to pay for tuition, working in student jobs, ordering takeout frequently.\n   Premise 5 does not provide any direct connection between these statements so we should consider other premise options that can help us link this conclusion.\n\n5. Consider the second statement of our conclusion: \"spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls.\"\n   This part is linked to two premises (4) which states enjoying dining hall meals results in spending lots of time there, or being a non picky eater.\n \n6. To conclude if Mary spends a lot of her time at college dining halls we need more information about whether she enjoys those meals or not.\n\n7. Let's look for connections with other premises to get that missing link:\n   Premise 3 states \"People either order takeout frequently in college, or enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes.\"\n   If Mary is a person then this premise could be applied.\n \n8. Since there are two options mentioned here (take out vs enjoying food) we can see if they help us to determine our conclusion.\n\n9. Let's apply them one by one:\n    Option 1: \"People order takeout frequently in college\" - This would lead Mary working on a job as described by premise 2, which is connected with needing money (premise 1). Premise does not connect eating habits.\n \n10. So let’s examine the other option of this statement that could help us determine our conclusion:\n    Option 2: \"People enjoy dining hall meals\" - This leads to two statements from premises (4) and (5).\n      If people are picky eaters, they would most likely not be enjoying campus food.\n \n11. Based on premise 3 we can conclude that Mary is either a person who enjoys the college dining halls or someone who frequently orders takeout.\n\n12. From option one in step nine we see there's no connection between eating habits and job requirements (premises).\n\n13. Option two from step eleven helps us understand that if Mary is enjoying campus food, then she could be spending lots of time at those places as stated by premise 4.\n \n14. And according to premises statement five: If people enjoy dining hall meals they are not picky eaters.\n\n15. With this new information we can confirm our conclusion about what eating habits or activities Mary might have:\n   - Option two from step eleven allows us connect \"enjoying campus food\" with spending lots of time at the college (premise 4) and being a non-picky eater.\n \n16. Therefore, based on premise connections in steps nine through fifteen we can conclude that if she is indeed enjoying dining hall meals then her conclusion about eating habits will be confirmed.\n\n17. Given all premises information our final answer is:\n   Answer: The final answer is A",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n1. The conclusion states that \"Dried Thai chilies are a product of Baked by Melissa.\" However, we need to determine if this is true or false based on the given premises.\n\n2. We start with premise 4: All products of Baked by Melissa are cupcakes.\n   This tells us about what can be produced by 'Baked by Melissa', but it doesn't directly relate to dried Thai chilies yet.\n\n3. Moving forward, we examine premise 5 which states that if \"dried Thai chilies are spicy or a bakery,\" then they must either be \"a hotpot\" or \"spicy\".\n   This creates two conditional possibilities: (i) If the dried Thai chilies are spicy; it means they could also potentially be 'hotpots' since all hotpots in premise 3 are indeed spicy. \n   Alternatively, if the dried Thai chilies are a bakery (and therefore not necessarily spicy), then they must still either be a \"hotpot\" or \"spicy\".\n\n4. We can use this information to narrow down possibilities.\n\n5. Since we know that no bakery is spicy from premise 1 and all hotpots in premise 3 are indeed spicy, it means the only possibility left for dried Thai chilies being 'a hotpot' would require them also being \"spicy\" (based on what was stated in premise 5).\n\n6. However, if we were to assume that dried Thai chilies could be a bakery then they must either be spicy or a hotpot as per the condition provided.\n\n7. Premise 2 states: All cupcakes are bakeries.\n   We know from premise 4 that all products of Baked by Melissa are indeed \"cupcakes\". Hence, anything produced by 'Baked by Melissa' is automatically classified under \"bakery\".\n\n8. With this in mind and the fact provided in step 5 about dried Thai chilies possibly being a bakery (in order to satisfy the condition mentioned), we now have another possible connection between dried Thai chilies and Baked By Melissa - that they could be considered as 'a product of' it.\n\n9. Since all products from \"Baked by Melissa\" are cupcakes, according to premise 4; if Dried Thai Chilies can also fit into the category of a bakery (and hence automatically classified under cupcake due to premises 2 and 4), then that would make them indeed 'a product' of Baked By Melissa.\n\n10. Now let's analyze the conclusion - \"Dried Thai chilies are a product of Baked by Melissa.\"\n    We already determined in step 9, given our deductions from previous steps, it appears to be possible for Dried Thai Chilies being classified as products made by 'Baked by Melissa'.\n\nHowever we cannot definitively confirm if this classification is correct or incorrect based on premises alone; because the conditions provided also leave open other possibilities.\n\n11. Based on step 10 and given that dried Thai chilies can satisfy both sides of premise 5, one possible conclusion could be true but it would still not fully cover all cases which leaves room for uncertainty in some scenarios.\n\n\nStep by Step Conclusion:\n \nConsidering our deductions from the premises provided to us; we have found a way through which \"Dried Thai Chilies\" might indeed qualify as 'products of Baked By Melissa' based on conditions and classifications outlined within these premises, however there are still other possible cases where this does not hold true.\n\nTherefore:\n\nThe final answer is C",

As per step 1, no bakery is considered to be spicy; however, this does not necessarily mean it cannot share other properties such as 'spicy'.\n6. Since dried Thai chilies must belong to the category of either being hotpots (if we consider them a 'hotpot') or are in fact spicy according to step 4's condition and no bakery is considered spicy from our first premise, then they would have to be classified under one other option: not belonging to Baked by Melissa products.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is A.",

The second premise states all cupcakes are bakeries and the fourth premise says all products of Baked by Melissa are cupcakes. This implies that any product from 'Baked by Melissa' will also satisfy being a bakery because they have already satisfied one condition (being a cupcake). \n3. Given this, dried Thai chilies cannot be spicy based on the first two premises and if we consider them as products of Baked by Melissa or similar, it could still hold.\n4. However, since 'Baked By Melissa' cupcakes are not explicitly stated to include all possible baked items under its brand name in order for us to prove that dried Thai chilies aren't a bakery or spicy based solely on being from this company we must look into the rest of given information \n5. The fifth premise says: if something is either 'spicy, or a bakery' then it can be classified as one of two things - hotpot and/or spicy.\n6. Now looking at our premises for dried Thai chilies ('hotpots are spicy'), we cannot use them to prove the conclusion that they're hotpots because there's no direct information stating if 'dried Thai Chilies' belong in this category, however, since it can be one of two possibilities and also belongs to a bakery based on our earlier analysis, \n7. We know dried Thai chilies are either spicy or bakeries (the latter being true as per previous steps), therefore they fit into the possible categories stated by premise 5.\n8. However we cannot yet determine if it's specifically 'spicy' but since all hotpots in general are indeed 'hot and/or spicy', there is a direct implication that 'dried Thai chilies could be considered one of those two possibilities, given they must fit into either being both or just the first.\n9. The last step before reaching our answer will involve looking at premise 5 again - which gives us two options ('spicy' and/or 'hotpot') for any item that satisfies being spicy as well as a bakery; we've already established dried Thai chilies satisfy these premises\n10. Since all hotpots are indeed spicy according to the information given in our initial statement (premise 3), if something is both a bakery or spicy then it would fit into this category ('hotpot').\n11. Given that, and because we know from steps before that dried Thai chilies can be classified under being either 'spicy' OR a bakery based on previous reasoning and also considering our premises - which state hotpots are indeed spicy (premise 3), \n12. This means the only way to categorize this item would fit into both categories ('hotpot').\n\nAnswer: The final answer is A) True",

The given premises are analyzed as follows:\n\n- Premise 1: If a restaurant is listed in Yelp's recommendations, then it does not receive many negative reviews.\n- Premise 2: All restaurants with ratings greater than 9 are listed in Yelp’s recommendations.\n- Premise 3: Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews. This premise implies there may be a restaurant without a takeout option but the exact statement is more of an implication about 'some', which means we don't necessarily have to consider this for our conclusion as it can potentially apply to other things.\n- Premise 4: All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than 9. This premise indicates that being popular and having high rating go hand in hand.\n- Premise 5: Subway has a rating greater than 9 or is popular among local residents.\n\n2. Given the premises, we want to determine if Subway does not provide take-out service (our conclusion).\n\n3. Since 'Subway' isn't mentioned anywhere with regards to it having no take out option in our given information set so we will be working backward from premise 5.\n\n4. From Premise 5: Subway has a rating greater than 9 or is popular among local residents.\n   - If the first part of this disjunction (rating > 9) holds, then by Premises 2 and 1 it must have no negative reviews in Yelp’s recommendations because it's listed as recommended.\n\n5. Now we need to see if Subway could be 'popular' with locals; which means that from premise 4: All restaurants popular among local residents would also fall under the high rating category (greater than 9).\n\n6. There is nothing that contradicts or supports our conclusion directly about take out service in any of these premises, but since we have to reach a decision based on what's provided and if Subway falls into either 'rating > 9' or being popular among locals which by premise 4 would both mean rating > 9.\n\n7. In neither case does the information imply anything regarding whether it offers take out service or not; thus, there isn't enough evidence to directly conclude Subway doesn’t provide a takeout option based on given premises.\n\n\nAnswer: The final answer is C) Unknown",

Given that if animals are loved by tourists then they are Max's favorite animals (Premise 1), we can conclude that all quoka are Max's favorite animal.\n4. However, since not all of the information provided is about Koalas being in favor with max directly but it does mention koala and its properties such as fluffiness which relates to another one of Max' favourite animals indirectly through other premises.\n\n5. From Premise 6: If a koala is very fluffy then the koala is not a quokka, this implies that if there are any Koalas that fit all these criteria (being in max's favorite and being from Australia) they cannot be Quoka because it states one of two mutually exclusive conditions.\n   \n   Since we know animals which are Max' favourite have to be fluffy or love sleeping then a koala must either be very fluffy, but as per the last premise that would mean its not quokka hence it can't also fit all other properties mentioned in premises 3 and 2 at once. Alternatively if Koalas do indeed sleep they still wouldn’t satisfy max’s favorite criteria directly because of this contradiction.\n\n6. Considering Premise 5: All of Max's favorite animals are very fluffy or love to sleep, we have two possibilities for a koala being one of them:\n    - If it is very fluffy (which would then make the premise about quoka false), then that makes Koalas not be in max' favorites because all his faves must either sleep or be fluffy. Thus making sleeping an attribute they might share but can't have.\n   - The other possibility from Premise 5 is if it loves to sleep, however this doesn’t provide any contradiction with the premises and as per our current analysis about koalas being very fluffy (and therefore not a quokka) we could say that all Koala’s are in max’ favorite category but since they do satisfy one of two mutually exclusive conditions stated above for them.\n\n7. Since from step 6 if it loves to sleep then there isn’t any contradiction with the premises about Max favourite animals being either fluffy or loving to sleep so, given this analysis we can safely assume that Koalas might be in max' favourites but since they are not very fluffy as per last premise and also must love sleeping hence no direct conclusion could ever come from here.\n\nHowever, using a process of elimination it seems logical for us to accept the following based on these premises:\n\n- All animals loved by tourists would make them Max's favourite. \n- But if that were indeed true then quokkas can't be very fluffy and therefore not max’s faves.\n- It follows from this reasoning step we could deduce all of koalas being in Australia or elsewhere are also max’ favourites based on their ability to sleep but it doesn’t guarantee them loving sleeping.",

We cannot directly conclude that all animals from Australia are Max's favorite based on the given premises.\n7. However, combining this information with premise 1 and our findings in step 2 about Australian animals being loved by tourists we can infer: \n   - Since quokkas (a type of animal) love to sleep as a result of having that status among Australian wildlife (based off premises), it makes them potential favorites for Max.\n\nNow let's focus on the conclusion. Given our findings and deductions so far:\n- We know from premise 5, if an Australian koala is very fluffy then 'it' must not be quokka.\n   - However this doesn't mean a non-fluffy or unmentioned type of quoka isn't also loved by tourists; \n     nor does it say that every quokka in Australia can be classified as both \"loved\" and  \"not-love sleeping\".\n8. As stated before, all the premises given don’t give any evidence to support a koala being one of Max’s favorite animals.\n9. Given this information we still cannot confirm whether or not koalas are among those quoka that love sleep.\n\nHowever if it is said in premise 5: If an Australian animal (which would include quokkas as per third statement) isn't very fluffy then the sixth premised does make a valid claim to classify any of these animals - thus we can be certain they do not belong to this \"very-fluffy\" group which leaves one conclusion.",

We are given that \"If animals are loved by tourists, then they are Max's favorite animals.\"\n   However this information isn't being used in the conclusion we're trying to validate.\n\n2. The next premise states \"All animals from Australia are loved by tourists.\" This is relevant because it links quokkas (from Australia) with something else.\n   \n3. Then, it says \"All quokka are animals from Australia,\" which further establishes a link between quokkas and being from Australia.\n\n4. It also mentions that all of Max's favorite animals love to sleep, but this is not relevant for our conclusion about the properties of koalas or quokkas in relation to each other.\n\n5. Another premise states \"All of Max's favorite animals are very fluffy.\" Again, while interesting information it does not relate directly to determining whether a quokka can be both very fluffy and love sleep based on its classification as an animal from Australia which is loved by tourists or anything else related in the premises provided.\n\n6. The last premise says \"If a koala is very fluffy, then the koala is not a quokka.\" This is relevant information because it helps us determine what cannot be true of animals that are both very fluffy and (in this context) could potentially be classified as quokkas.\n\n7. We're trying to validate if the following statement holds: \"If a koala is a quokka, then the koala either loves to sleep or is very fluffy.\"\n   \n8. Given all these premises let's try breaking down our conclusion and see what can logically follow from them.\n   - If a koala IS A QUOKKA (and not just any type of animal), it MUST be an ANIMAL FROM AUSTRALIA, as per premise 3.\n\n9. As an ANIMAL FROM AUSTRALIA it must also be LOVED BY TOURISTS according to premises 2 and the conclusion's first assumption about a quokka being a koala (or at least for this problem).\n\n10. Since we're working under the assumption of a koala being a type of animal that is loved by tourists, then as per premise one it must be Max's favorite animal.\n\n11. Given all these premises and our assumptions let's try to validate whether a quokka can both LOVE TO SLEEP AND BE VERY FLUFFY.\n    - From the information provided we know: \n      * Koalas are very fluffy (if they were not, according to premise 6 then it could be classified as something other than just \"not a quokka\").\n      * Quokkas love sleep because of being one type of animal that Max likes which in turn is an Australia based loved by tourist animal.\n\n12. Based on these premises and our thought process let's try validating whether the conclusion can indeed hold.\n    - Our conclusion says if A koala (assuming it to be a quokka for this problem) then either loves sleep or very fluffy, but what we know from premise 6 is that \"If a koala IS VERY FLUFFY THEN IT CAN'T BE classified as something other than just 'not a quokka', implying the reverse also holds - i.e., if it's not very fluffy and instead is a type of animal (in this case, a quokka), then there are no premises that rule out an individual being both love to sleep AND be classified as such.\n\nBased on these steps we can now try validating whether our conclusion indeed follows from the premises. \n\nAnswer: The final answer is A) True",

Now let's analyze what we can conclude about Harry being either kind (K) or a CEO from the premises:\n   - A man is either kind or evil.\n   - If all NH = E, it doesn't mean that not-NH=E, so there could be non-evil individuals who are also handsome.\n\n6. From point 5 above we have to use another premise which tells us about Harry's status of being a gentleman (Premise 7). Since 'All CEOs are gentlemen' and 'Harry is a gentleman', it follows that either Harry must not only be kind or he could possibly be a CEO because the premises don't provide any information regarding all non-evil individuals who are also handsome, whether they can hold this position. So there's no conclusion possible for his status of being a CEO from given info.\n\n7.

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning: \n\n1. The conclusion states that \"Luke complains often about annoying siblings.\" To determine if this is true, we need to analyze the given premises and see how they relate to Luke's situation.\n\n2. Premise 3 states that \"If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who are the same age.\" This implies that having same-age siblings can be a reason for complaining about them.\n\n3. However, premise 1 says that if someone is twins or triplets (which also includes same-age siblings), then they spend time with their siblings. There's no direct connection between being a twin/triplet and complaining about annoying siblings in the premises provided.\n\n4. Premise 2 states \"If people have siblings who are the same age, then they are twins or triplets.\" This implies that having same-age siblings means one is either a twin or triplet.\n\n5. The last premise we need to consider for this conclusion (complaining about annoying siblings) is actually not needed directly because it's more relevant when considering whether Luke developed strong bonds with his family members, but the critical piece of information comes from another part of the premises that links living at home and developing strong bond.\n\n6. Given Luke is either a twin/triplet or does not have any sibling relationships (according to premise), if he develops strong bonds with his family it would be more likely due to being twins/triplets which contradicts having siblings who are same age, but the fact that these two conditions cannot both happen suggests there must exist some information in one of premises about them.\n\n7. Premise 4 states \"If people do not live at home regularly, then they do not develop strong bonds with their family members.\" This implies that living away from home could prevent a person from forming close relationships with family.\n\n8. And premise 5 says \"If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often did not live at home regularly.\"\n\n9. Considering the information provided in premises about Luke: He can be either twins/triplets or have no sibling relationship (given by one premise), but we know he develops strong bonds which would mean living away from his family isn't possible according to premise 4.\n\n10. Therefore, if he didn’t live at home regularly it's not because of siblings and is actually a contradictory condition given in premises that suggests people who spend time with their sibling are likely those who did live apart (premise 5). This means living away from his family isn't possible for the reason stated as one of conditions when analyzing all information provided.\n\n11. As he develops strong bonds which would be due to being twins/triplets according to given premise, we have a contradiction in premises that if people are not twin or triplet they can’t develop those relationships and live away from home is actually linked with having siblings (premise 5).\n\n12. However this was the step where our logic went astray because one condition cannot both happen which suggests he must be living at home regularly to form bond according to premise.\n\n13. Considering all premises, if Luke develops strong bonds it means he doesn't live away from his family as stated by a given premise and hence contradicts being twins or triplets who actually spend more time with siblings (premise 2).\n\n14. As we've found that living at home is the reason for developing strong bond in one case but cannot be true if Luke is twin/triplet, then he can't develop those bonds because it will mean same age sibling which contradicts premise.\n\n15. Hence based on given premises about siblings and family relationships provided to us we know there must exist information that links two of conditions together such as not living away from home due to having sibling who are the same age.\n\n\n16. Given this analysis, Luke is more likely a twin or triplet (due to developing strong bonds according to premise), but if he develops those then it contradicts another given condition where people spend time with their siblings and hence cannot be true for being twins/triplets.\n\n17. But as we have established that living away from home would mean no bond which is actually one of the two options available in Luke's case, this means not a twin or triplet but rather does develop strong bonds (premise 2).\n\n18. As premise says people who spend time with their siblings did live at home regularly and hence cannot be true for being twins/triplets due to living away.\n\n19. Given that he develops those relationships then it must mean one of other condition provided about sibling which is having same age, but this actually contradicts another given information.\n\n\n20. This means Luke can either not spend time with siblings or have no bond according to premises (since premise says if people do live at home they would develop strong bonds).\n\n\n21. But as we established earlier living away from his family isn't possible for the reason stated in one of conditions which is actually linked directly when analyzing all information provided about sibling.\n\n22.

All foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing (Premise 3). This implies that if someone is a foodie who goes out frequently, then they also spill a lot of food.\n3. Given this relationship between being a foodie and spilling food, we can infer the opposite: If Peter does not spill a lot of food, he cannot be a frequent food restaurant-goer (Premise 2).\n4. From Premises 1 and 5, if people have parents who are very busy with their regular jobs, then they grew up as only children with no siblings.\n   Then from premise 6: All households with a high net income have people who have parents who are very busy with their regular jobs.\n   This implies that all households with high incomes also had at least one child in them. \n5. We can deduce two possible scenarios for Peter based on Premise 7:\n- Either he is both someone who spills food and grew up as an only child, or\n- He does not fall into either of these categories (not a person who spills a lot of food nor grew up with no siblings).\n6. If Peter does spill a lot of food, then from premise 4: since his parents were busy working they must have had at least one other child in the house.\n   This contradicts our earlier scenario that if people are only children their household income is low (Premise 2 and Premise 5).\n7. Therefore Peter cannot be a person who spills food on clothing, because this would imply he did not grow up as an \"only child.\"\n8. Since we know from step 6: If someone does spill food then they must have grown up in a household with at least two children (from premise 4), \n   and if Peter is not the type who spills food on clothing, it means that his family income can be high because his parents are working full time.\n9. From Premise 6 we know all households with high incomes also had busy parents which implies they have at least one child in them (from premise 4).\n10. Therefore if Peter is not a person who spills food on clothing, it must mean that he belongs to either household type - those without two children or the ones that do but are still quite well off.\n   Given from step 5: The only other alternative we have for him would be belonging in one of these high-income households with at least one child.\n\nAnswer: \nThe final answer is A.",

We know that Michael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class, and Peter is a man who is taller than Michael.\n   - From premise 4: If person x is taller than person y, and person y is taller than person z, then x is taller than z\n     It can be inferred from the given premises that Michael > anyone-in-Michael's-class (which includes Windy) \n     And Peter > Michael.\n\n2. Therefore, we have a transitive relationship: Peter > anyone-in-Michael's-class.\n   - We know this because of our inference in step 1 and premise 4.\n\n3. However, to determine if Peter can block Windy's shooting specifically,\n    it is essential to examine the premises related directly to blocking or not blocking shots.\n- Premise 6: Michael cannot block Windy's shooting (this does not mention anything about Peter).\n  \n4. To figure out whether a taller person can block another shooter, we look at premise 1:\n   - It says that if one man is taller than another, he can block the other's shooting.\n   But this doesn't necessarily imply that height alone is sufficient for blocking shots.\n\n5. From premise 3: Michael > anyone-in-Michael's-class (including Windy) and \n    from premise 2 we know Peter > Michael. Thus Peter must also be taller than everyone in his class including windy.\n\n6. Premise 4 tells us that if person x is taller than y, who is then taller than z,\n   it means x > z.\n- So since peter > michael (who > anyone-in-his-class) we can infer: \n    Peter > Windy.\n\n7. The only condition under which Michael cannot block a shot from someone in his class is\n  when that person jumps while shooting, as stated by premise 3 and also the fact mentioned above.\n8. There's no information about windy being able to jump or not; nor any other shooter who can't jump for comparison.\n\n9. We know Peter > Windy (from our transitive relationship in step 2) but it still needs \n    to be determined if that height is sufficient enough for blocking shots, as seen with premise 1.\n   - There's no information about the minimum required height or other factors necessary for a person to block shots.\n\n10. As Peter > Windy and Michael cannot block windy because he can jump (we're going by this assumption based on his inability \n    to be blocked) but there is nothing stating that any of these people have the ability to jump,\n     it seems more likely that height alone was enough for blocking, as given in premise 1.\n\n11. Since Peter > Windy and premise 1 states taller person can block shooting if they don't jump while doing so \n    then we should be able to safely say:  \n   - \"If windy jumps when shooting\" is not the only case where Michael cannot shoot but that's also the assumption\n     for this conclusion.\n\n12. Since there are no other premises stating Peter or Windy can jump, it seems safe enough in our current \n    knowledge base to assume they're like everyone else who isn't mentioned as a jumper.\n   - So we could infer both windy and peter probably don't have the ability to jump (because nothing is said about them).\n\n13. From premise 1: If person x > y, then he can block y's shot if that doesn't involve jumping for y \n    in this case Peter would be able to since his height gives him an advantage over windy.\n\n14. Now knowing from previous steps the only factor which could affect whether someone blocks a shot is their ability\n   - And assuming they don't jump when doing so (as seen with premise 3 about Michael) and also because there's no other \n     information to contradict this assumption in our knowledge base, then Peter should be able to block windy.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is A.",

Now combining steps 2-4: since all airlines can transport multiple passengers and thus must not be empty (from premises 1 & 2), while it's also known that all planes (which includes airline operated vehicles) are indeed empty; this seems to create a contradiction unless we separate the two statements into categories.\n6.

From steps 3 and 4, since it's established that airlines aren't empty due to transporting multiple passengers (from premises 1 & 2) but all planes are indeed empty; this implies there must be a different category for airlines - not just any plane.\n8. Since we have concluded in step 7 that an airline cannot also be categorized under 'planes', the premise about Greyhound being classified as either an airline or having no associated Boeing airplanes is inconsequential to the main argument about categorizing a specific type of vehicle (Boeing).\n9. Now let's focus on our original conclusion, \"A Greyhound is a Boeing 707\". To see if it follows logically from these premises:\n- We don't have any direct information in the given statements that directly connects 'Greyhound' with being an airline or its ability to transport multiple passengers (other than premise about greyhound and planes).\n- However, since we established earlier airlines aren’t empty due to transporting multiple passengers; there must be a separate category for such vehicles - which includes Boeing 707s. This conclusion does not necessarily mean all Greyhounds can't be airplanes or cannot have the ability of being classified under 'planes'. \n10.

From this information alone, we can't conclude anything specific about Rock or its relationship to wings.\n\n3. We're told in the second premise that all monkeys are mammals, but again, this doesn't provide any direct evidence for whether Rock has wings or not.\n\n4. The third premise states a classification rule: an animal is either a monkey or a bird. This provides more information about what animals can be classified as.\n\n5. We know from previous premises (1 and 2) that mammals are also included in the category of \"animals\" mentioned here, but we don't have any direct connection to Rock yet.\n\n6. From premise four (\"All birds fly.\"), it seems like flying is exclusive to birds based on this statement alone. But there's still more information provided about animals breathing from premise five and that something can only be a bird if they are able to fly in the sixth premise, along with a logical conclusion: \"If Rock is neither a fly nor a bird\" - which suggests an analysis of categories.\n\n7. Based on premises 5 (\"All birds fly.\") & 6, we deduce that anything other than a flying creature must not be classified as a bird or it's a monkey according to premise three since there are no other animal classifications mentioned in this context.\n\n8. Premise seven states: \"If something can fly, then it has wings.\" This tells us about the connection between an object being able to fly and having wings. It implies that all flying creatures have wings but doesn't necessarily say anything directly about non-flying animals or Rock specifically.\n\n\n9. The eighth premise introduces a new piece of information relevant to Rock's characteristics: \"If Rock is neither a fly nor a bird, then Rock neither flies nor breathes.\" This statement suggests an indirect way to determine if something (Rock) has certain properties.\n\n10. From the classification rule mentioned in step 4 (\"an animal is either a monkey or a bird\") we now can see that there are only three categories: birds, monkeys and animals which aren't classified as either of those two types but according to premise seven would have wings if they could fly.\n\n\n11. We're given no direct information linking Rock's ability to breathe with any other properties like having wings in the premises provided.\n\n12. Since we don't know whether \"Rock\" is a monkey or not (which it may be), based on step 4, and since there are only two animal categories mentioned here that could have breath as well (\"bird\" & \"monkey\"), then anything which does breathe must either fly according to premise five or must be classified under one of these three types.\n\n\n13. We also know from the premises given in this question (especially premise seven) - something can't just not fit into any category mentioned here but still have properties like flying if it breaths and there's no other reason provided that could link breathing with having wings for a Rock which isn't classified as bird or monkey.\n\n\n14. This leaves us to analyze the classification of \"Rock\" based on premises given, in order to conclude whether they would breathe.\n\n15. Premise 3 tells us an animal is either a \"monkey\", a \"bird\". \n\n16. Given premise four: all birds fly and according to step seven (\"If something can fly then it has wings\") - only flying objects have the property of having wings, but that does not imply anything about Rock which isn't mentioned as being able to breathe or an object with no known classification.\n\n17. Based on premises given we deduce if a non-bird animal is a monkey and according to premise two \"all monkeys are mammals\", then they must be animals too - thus they would have breath, but not necessarily wings.\n\n\n18. Given that Rock isn't classified as being either bird or monkey based upon the information provided here (steps 12-17) we conclude it neither flies nor breaths.\n\n19. As a result of steps above: according to premise eight (\"if something can fly then it has wings\") and because \"Rock\" is not able to breathe which implies, given other premises that Rock doesn't have flying properties either - in order for this conclusion to be true we need an additional information or implication from one of the provided premises about having breath as well.\n\n\n20. Since premise 8 states: something can fly then it has wings but none of these premises directly state anything else which would link a \"Rock\" with being able to breathe so based on all premises, steps and analysis above we conclude that there is no direct evidence linking Rock's ability to have wings.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is C) Unknown",

The conclusion to be determined is \"Rock does not have wings.\" We must examine the provided premise (\"If Rock is neither a fly nor a bird, then Rock neither flies nor breathes.\") (Premise 6).

The fact remains we don't know about its wing status directly from the information provided but can infer something indirectly via negative reasoning.\n\n\nHowever looking at our initial task of determining whether rock has wings or not based on premises, it’s safe to say that none of these premises provide us with explicit statement linking rock having a property (wings) due to belonging in category such as mammals.

We're given \"All weddings that occur in July belong to people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon.\" If we assume there are well-attended weddings in July, it means these must involve individuals going to Paris as part of a wedding.\n\n4. Combining premises 1 and the conclusion: \n\"If John has at least one child, then John does not have a wedding\" (because children imply no wedding), which also implies that he cannot be among those traveling to Paris in July for his honeymoon based on point #2.\nHowever, since we are given \"If John has a wedding that is well-attended, then John either travels to Paris or the wedding occurs in July,\" it follows logically from this statement and premise 3 (weddings occur in Paris) that if someone's wedding was attended, they would have been traveling.\n\n5. Combining all our points: \nFrom point #1 we know weddings involve children; however, those with a child cannot get married as per the premises given.\nHowever, according to \"If John has a wedding that is well-attended, then John either travels or it's in July,\" if someone gets wed and their nuptials are attended they must have been traveling (in Paris) based on point 3.\n\nTherefore, \nSince getting a child and having a wedding cannot coexist as per our premises: we can now say that for the person described by the conclusion to be true John would not fit this description since it was established he has children from premise #1 which implies he's among those who don't get married.",

We are given that all people who have a wedding are people who have at least one child (Premise 1) and if John has at least one child, then John does not travel to Paris for his honeymoon and does not have a wedding (Premise 5).\n2. This implies two things about John: he may or may not be someone with children but either way it's said that they don't get married.\n3. Now we are given another piece of information - all people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon are people who have at least one child (Premise 1) and if John has a wedding, then he does not go on his honeymoon in Paris because of premise 5.\n4. Since some weddings in July belong to the group that travels to Paris (Premise 3), this means all such weddings must also be well-attended as per given data but we cannot use it directly without knowing whether John had a wedding or not. \n5. We have another piece of information - if John has a wedding that is well-attended, then he either gets married in July and travels to Paris for their honeymoon (Premise 4) OR does travel to Paris for his honeymoon.\n6. Here we get stuck because premise 2 already said they don't go on the trip even though this one says otherwise. So which statement do you believe? \n7. Since, both statements cannot be true at once and John can only have a wedding that is well-attended if it's in July or he travels to Paris for their honeymoon (Premise 4), we are left with just one option - the first part of premise 2.\n8. If that’s so then all weddings that occur in July belong to people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon which will make John have a well-attended wedding if it was indeed true.\n\nBut there is more! \n9. We know from our previous steps, that we can't just assume they go on the trip or get married in july.\n10. Let's combine premise 4 and premise 5: If John has at least one child, then he does not travel to Paris for his honeymoon and does not have a wedding (Premise 5) which implies all weddings of people who are parents will be well attended because if they werent in july or paris it would make them contradict themselves.\n11. This means that the premise saying some July weddings must go to Paris contradicts our previous assumption about John's child status, so we cannot use it.\n\nNow let’s examine our initial conclusion:\n\"\"\"\nJohn does not have a wedding that is well-attended.\n\"\"\"\n\nStep 12: Since all people who travel for their honeymoon are parents (Premise 1), and if they were parents then the statement in premise 5 would hold true which makes them never get married or go to Paris. \n13. However, this implies John does have a wedding because we already know he can't be one of those going on trips due to having kids so all other statements do not apply.\n14. And if that’s correct then there is no reason why his wedding wouldnt’ be well-attended since premise 3 only said some weddings were and did not say they are the ones traveling, it could have been any one.\n\nBut wait! \n15. If John does indeed get married (which we now know from step 13) but this time doesn't travel to Paris because he has children then all that remains is for us to check if his wedding was in July.\n16. We don’t need premise 3 anymore since it only talks about a specific type of well-attended weddings which would be those traveling to paris, not john’s.\n\nNow let's see what happens when we combine everything:\n\"\"\"\nIf John has at least one child, then he does not travel to Paris for his honeymoon and does not have a wedding.\nAll people who travel to Paris are parents (Premise 1)\nJohn is indeed a parent as per premise 5\nSo he must get married but this time in July because of premises 2 and the fact that it’s said some july weddings are well attended \n\"\"\"\n\nStep by step reasoning:\nWe have been able to find an inconsistency. \n\nAnswer: The final answer is B) False",

Based on point 2 and premise \"If John has at least one child, then John does not travel to Paris for his honeymoon and does not have a wedding,\" we can conclude that John does not have a wedding.\n4. Now considering the conclusion which states: \"John has neither a wedding that is well-attended nor does he travel to Paris for his honeymoon.\"\n5. We need to determine whether this conclusion follows from our premises.\n\nFrom point 3, we know that John doesn't have a wedding in general. However, premise (If John has a wedding that is well-attended...) gives us information about two cases: either the wedding occurs in July or it's not and he travels to Paris for his honeymoon.\n6. To evaluate this conclusion more closely, let's consider an alternate interpretation of what happens if we replace \"John\" with another person from our premises who does indeed travel to Paris for their well-attended honeymoon (which is implied by the statement that some weddings in July are well attended and all people traveling to Paris do so on a wedding). This seems somewhat ambiguous since it doesn't directly reference John's specific situation but instead uses generalities about what happens during his time of year.\n7. In this case, if we were talking specifically about another person who travels to Paris for their honeymoon in July (which could be considered well-attended) - given the other premises, that would not necessarily apply here since they do travel and have a wedding but it does seem plausible based on our information.\n\nHowever, considering John's situation: \n8. We know he has at least one child which means his premise of traveling to Paris for the honeymoon doesn't hold (he won't be going). The only other possible conclusion about weddings that are well-attended would relate back to point 5 where it says either in July or travels to Paris, but since John's situation already indicates that he will not travel and we know some people do have a wedding which is in July and goes to Paris (well attended) - this still does leave an open question about his specific wedding.\n\nHowever considering the information provided:\n- If John has at least one child then it cannot be that \"John travels for his honeymoon\" \n9. Also, if he's not having a well-attended wedding which is in July and doesn't travel to Paris (as per other premises) - given our general premise about weddings being well attended or traveling, there isn't any additional information provided from the conclusion.\n\nFrom these steps we have:\nStep 10: Since John cannot be at both ends of that spectrum \"having a wedding\" which is not in July and doesn't travel to Paris for his honeymoon based on all other premises - this seems somewhat contradictory with our premise stating he has one child (premise).\n\nHowever given the above logic flow, it's safe to say we've considered every possible outcome.\n10. Since John does have at least a child which is stated by another premise and also that information can't be used in conjunction for those other premises - this suggests he cannot attend Paris or his wedding being well attended as per our final conclusion.\n\n\n\nAnswer: The final answer is A) True",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. From the premises, we know that if a cartoon character is loved by children (P), then it is funny (Q). This can be represented as:\n   P → Q\n2. We also have another premise: If a cartoon character is from The Simpsons (R), then it is loved by children (S).\n   R → S\n3. And there's the additional information that if a cartoon character is yellow, then it is from The Simpsons.\n   Y → R\n\n4. Now let's break down what we know about Ben:\n- He might be either funny or from The Simpsons: \n  F ∨ T (where 'F' stands for \"funny\" and 'T' represents \"from The Simpsons\")\n5. To find out whether the conclusion is true, false, or unknown, we need to see if there's enough information provided in the premises about Ben being loved by children.\n\n6. Since there are multiple conditions that might apply (Ben could be funny or from The Simpsons), let’s look at each condition separately:\n- If Ben is funny: This doesn't necessarily imply he's loved by children, because we only know it if a character is both ugly and not popular.\n  Hence the information \"If a cartoon character is funny then it is popular\" does provide an additional clue but still leaves many unknowns. \n - However, there are also other premises that could be used to solve this problem: We have a premise saying Ben might either be from The Simpsons or he's funny.\n\n7. Let’s evaluate the second condition (Ben being from The Simpsons) separately:\n   If Ben is from The Simpsons then we know for sure it must mean \"he is loved by children\", because that directly comes out of one of our premises.\n- Since if a cartoon character is yellow, and also happens to be from 'The Simpson's', this could provide another clue about whether or not he indeed has those two conditions fulfilled.\n\n8. The premise: If Ben is either funny or from The Simpsons means there are potentially multiple paths that can make the conclusion true:\n   - Either by being \"funny\" (but as mentioned earlier, we have many other premises and variables to take into account) \n     OR\n   - Alternatively if he's indeed yellow then because of this new information: If a cartoon character is yellow then it must be from The Simpsons; in addition using the premise that says 'if a cartoon character is loved by children' (this would happen under one specific set condition, and so far we know it has to do with being either funny or part of The Simpson's).\n   \n9. Since there are two conditions for which Ben could possibly fulfill: Either he’s funny OR yellow; these both imply different things about whether the conclusion can be made true.\n\n10. But if a cartoon character is ugly and not popular, then it would make them \"funny\" (based on one of our premises). This does provide another potential path by which we might solve for this problem.\n11. However there’s also an important thing to note about Ben being from the Simpsons: Being yellow implies that he must indeed be part of The Simpson's and hence loved.\n\n12. By now it should have become clear what information is provided in our premises, so let us take a look at these conditions once more:\n   - If we know something about his popularity or whether he’s funny (or not) this could provide crucial clues.\n     We can conclude that Ben being from The Simpsons means the conclusion must be true.\n\n13. From all of the information given above and by carefully following each premise, it is now possible to derive a final answer.\n\n\nAnswer: \nThe final answer is A",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n1. We are given that 'Ben is either from The Simpsons or funny'. \n   This can be written in logical terms as: (From_Simpsons ∨ Funny) Ben.\n\n2. From the premises, we know 'If a cartoon character is yellow, then it is from The Simpsons.' which translates to Yellow → From_Simpsons.\n   \n3. Using this information and applying modus ponens on '(From_Simpsons ∨ Funny) Ben' with premise 'Yellow → From_Simpsons', \n   if we assume that 'Ben is yellow (yellow Ben)', we can conclude using the hypothetical syllogism rule: (From_Simpsons ∨ Funny) Ben ⊃ Yellow_Ben → (From_Simpsons ∨ Funny)_Ben.\n   \n4. Since from step 1, '(From_Simpsons ∨ Funny)_Ben' has been established, and assuming 'Yellow Ben', we can conclude that it is indeed true.\n\n5. We are now left with two possibilities for the character of Ben: either he's funny or yellow (or both).\n\n6. The premises inform us that if a cartoon character is ugly, then it isn't popular.\n   Also from premise 3 and 4, 'If a cartoon character loved by children, then it is funny' and \n   'if a cartoon character is from The Simpsons, then it's loved by children'. However we have no direct information about Ben being either an unsightly or not unsightly.\n\n7. We can use the hypothetical syllogism rule once more to consider two cases:\n    - If Ben isn't funny (not_Funny_Ben) and he is yellow, \n      then using premise 3 'If a cartoon character is loved by children, then it's funny', we cannot determine whether or not he is popular. But from step 6 we know that if the cartoon is an unsightly one, then it isn't well-liked.\n    - If Ben isn't funny and he isn’t yellow (not_Funny_and_not_yellow_Ben) \n      since there are no premises about him being ugly which directly links to not Funny or not Yellow. We can neither confirm nor deny if he is an unsightly one.\n\n8. Given these two scenarios, we know that only in the case of Ben being funny would we have a conclusion on whether 'Ben is popular' but unfortunately for our purposes it's irrelevant because from premise 4 and step 5,\n   we established either way (funny or yellow) he can be classified as one.\n\n9. Thus given all this, considering that if there are no premises about him being unsightly which directly links to not Funny or not Yellow then 'Ben is ugly' has a lack of evidence in both cases and hence remains unknown.\n\n10. Therefore, we have determined that the conclusion \"If Ben is either from The Simpsons or funny, \n   then he's yellow\" isn't true but what was actually given as conclusion: \"Ben is Ugly OR Yellow.\"",

      "raw": "\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n\n1. We are given that if a cartoon character is funny, then it is popular (premise 1). \n   But we don't know anything about Ben being funny or not yet.\n\n2. Next premise states that if a cartoon character is ugly, then it's not popular (premise 2).\n   This information alone doesn’t help us to conclude much because there’s no connection between ugliness and yellow color in the premises given.\n\n3. We also have another condition which says 'if Ben loves children or he is from The Simpsons' - this means if a character is loved by children, it's funny (premise 3).\n   However we cannot directly say whether ben is popular because there are many possibilities like him being ugly and not funny at the same time.\n\n4. Since premise 1 says that 'if Ben loves children or he is from The Simpsons', this means if a character is loved by children then it's funny, but in premises given, only characters who love kids can be either funny (premise 3) OR they are yellow and hence part of the simpsons.\n\n5. Now let’s assume that \"Ben\" loves children which makes him 'funny'. But premise doesn't say anything about Ben being ugly or not.\n   However we know from our previous assumption in step-4, if a character is funny then he has to be either yellow (premise 6), OR loved by kids.\n\n6. Now let’s try the opposite of what was assumed in Step -5: \n    Assume that \"Ben\" isn't 'funny', which makes him not from The Simpsons because premise says only characters who are part of simpsons and hence funny, or yellow can be either funny (premise 3). As we have already concluded Ben is not funnier so he must be a non-simpson character.\n\n7. If \"Ben\" isn't 'funny' which means ben cannot be from The Simpsons because premise says only characters who are part of simpsons and hence funny, or yellow can be either funny (premise 3), then there's another possible conclusion that Ben is neither Yellow nor loved by children which implies he could also not be ugly.\n\n8. If we conclude in step-7: 'ben' cannot love kids because \"he isn't funnier so ben must be a non-simpson character\" this makes us think of the possibilities when premises talk about ugliness.\n    Given that, if Ben is neither yellow nor from The Simpsons (which implies he's not funny and hence we already concluded), then there are two possible conclusions: either \"Ben\" isn't ugly OR \"ben\" could be a mix of both.\n\n9. However as premise 5 states 'if ben loves children which makes him funnier' but it does not say anything about the opposite condition, if he is NOT from simpsons or funny because that would mean ben has to love kids in order for us to make any conclusions.\n   Since we know \"Ben\" cannot be yellow and loved by children (premise 6), then either 'ben loves kids' which makes him funnier and hence ugly (given premise says if a character is from The Simpsons, he's not funny).\n   \n10. In the last step: \n    If ben isn't from simpsons because we have already concluded that \"he must be non-simpson\" so we can make one final conclusion:\n        - Either Ben loves kids which makes him funnier and hence ugly.\n        OR\n       'ben is neither yellow nor loved by children' (because if he's not funny then ben cannot be from simpsons or vice versa as concluded in step 7)\n\nConsidering all the possibilities, we can conclude that \"Ben\" could either love kids but would have to be an ugly character because premise says only characters who are part of simpsons and hence funny, or yellow can be either funny (premise 3), OR he is neither Yellow nor loved by children.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is A",

Furthermore, the premises state that \"A person either studys or teaches,\" meaning if someone doesn't teach, it must be because they study (or vice versa). \n\n4. We're given information about Jerry: he neither teaches nor is a manager. However, since we've determined from premise 2 and 3 that studying implies being human and students are equivalent to those who either study or teach, this piece of info does not help us directly in proving the conclusion.\n\n5. Another key point is \"No young person teaches.\" Since teaching can be replaced with 'not studies' (given a person will do one or the other), no young persons must then 'study'.\n\n6. The last relevant premise we have here states that \"Rose is young or a student,\" but since, based on our deduction from steps 4 and 5, if someone doesn't teach they study; it implies Rose cannot be both young (as she would not study) nor an adult.\n\n7. Based on the information in step one, because we know Jerry neither teaches nor manages, this fact can help us determine that \"A person either studies or teaches\" does indeed include studying as a viable alternative to teaching but also means someone is human if they are 'students' (as stated at premise 1), meaning Rose will always be a human.\n\n8. Finally, since we cannot confirm whether Jerry is young or an adult from the information given in this problem and there isn't enough evidence about him studying (which would make him human based on our first step) to establish he's definitely not 'a manager', all that can safely be inferred at present here with what little data does exist for Rose, however we know she is a \"human\" - making the statement of whether or not \"Rose is a human or a manager.\" A certainty as long as humans are indeed capable of being managers.\n\n9. We must take into consideration now if Jerry is an adult and therefore studying; this would imply that since he's also human, then it follows from premise 1 (all students/humans) and our other premises about Rose (young or a student), she could potentially be either young or study - which again implies 'she' must always fall into the category of being \"a manager\" because we have established Jerry is an adult based on him studying, then that leaves only option for her to fit in with: Manager.\n\nTherefore our answer is \nThe final answer is B",

Since Rose's age or being a student are her two possible classifications as per Premises 1 and 2; given from premise five the statement 'or' can't be ignored here for conclusion about Jerry\n9. Combining premises four (no young person teaches) with six, we know that since she is not old, then in this case only one option remains: Rose studies.\n10. Given all information up to now and combining it into a single premise from steps 1-4 regarding students being humans as well as conclusions made by steps five through nine; let's proceed\n11. As stated above Jerry must be human because he is either studying (which implies student, thus implying 'human' given premises) or teaching.\n12. Combining this information with the fact that Rose studies from step 9 and students are humans per premise one we now know both conclusions for our problem have been found \n13. From steps 11-12 if Jerry is human then he would indeed be a student as well since all of these classifications lead to 'human' when using given premises; which contradicts the final conclusion provided.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is B) False",

From the first premise, if people own a large desktop monitor at their home (let's call this condition A), then they work regularly and often at home.\n2. The second premise states that all people who have a fully stocked and impressive home office are those who own a large desktop monitor at their home. This implies that having a fully stocked home office is another way to describe owning a large desktop monitor (condition A).\n3. From the third premise, we know that if someone works regularly and often at home (again condition A), then they spend their free time tidying and organizing spaces in their homes.\n4. The fourth premise states that all people who work regularly and often at home visit the office supply store regularly.\n\nNow let's break down Remy's situation:\n\n- From the last given statement, we can say two things about Remy: either (a) they go to bed late and wake up after noon but also spend their free time tidying or (b) neither of these is true.\n5. If option (a) were true for Remy then from premise 3 it follows that Remy must work regularly at home, as people who do this are the ones spending time on organizing spaces in their homes. Then with a similar reasoning to step 4 we can conclude they visit office supply stores regularly.\n\nHowever because of how condition A is defined there could also be an alternative explanation for option (a) being true: it would suffice if Remy has fully stocked and impressive home offices as per premise two, meaning that the fact that people owning large monitors implies working at their homes directly isn't necessary here. We can therefore use this information to conclude they go back to step 1 of our previous process but now we have an additional piece of knowledge: condition A is true for Remy because either one or both premises (2 and/or) are being used.\n\n6. On the other hand, if option (b) were true then it follows directly from premise 5 that they do not spend their free time tidying spaces in their home.\n7. But since we know Remy must work regularly at home because of this fact combined with premises two and three, so by step four, Remy would visit office supply stores.\n\nConsidering the possible scenarios for option (b), if condition A is true then from steps 4 and 5 it follows that they do indeed go to bed late wake up after noon but we could also use premise one as an alternative explanation here. Hence in this scenario we conclude they are visiting office supplies because of two different premises.\n\n8. So, combining our findings: regardless if the first part (going to sleep late and waking at noon) is true or not for Remy it must be that condition A holds true because both paths either option a or b lead us back to conclusion 4 where they visit office supply stores regularly.\n \nAnswer: The final answer is B.",

Now let's analyze another group of premises:\n   - If people work regularly and often at home then they own a large desktop monitor.\n   - All people who have a fully stocked and impressive home office are people who own a large desktop monitor.\n\n4. The last premise in this group can be rewritten as: \n   - If Remy has a fully stocked and impressive home office, then they must also work regularly at their home (since owning the monitor is implied).\n\n5. Another set of premises:\n   - All people who work regularly and often at home visit the office supply store regularly.\n   \n6. We can conclude from these two groups that if Remy has a fully stocked home office, it implies they own a large desktop monitor which in turn means they also spend their free time tidying (since working at home is required) and go to bed early.\n\n7. However we have another premise stating:\n   - If people work regularly and often at home then they visit the office supply store.\n   \n8. This makes it possible that Remy visits the store but doesn't necessarily need a fully stocked home office for this reason alone, since owning a large monitor is what connects both these premises.\n\n9. Since visiting the store could be due to working from home (which requires an owned desktop) rather than having a home office; we cannot determine if it's because of or despite Remy not spending free time tidying and organizing spaces in their homes.\n\n10.

We are given the information about Remy but do not directly know whether Remy owns a large desktop monitor or works from home.\n\n3. Since we don't have enough direct information to deduce our final answer immediately,\n    - Let's try to find out if Remy has any of these three properties: \n        * A) Has fully stocked and impressive office.\n        * B) Owns a large desktop monitor at their home.\n        * C) Works regularly from the home.\n\n4. From Premise 2, it is clear that having an impressive home office means they have property (B).\n    - Since this information implies Remy owns a large desktop monitor if and only if they work at home frequently \n      we can conclude that owning a large desktop monitor directly relates to working from home\n\n5. Next step: From Premise 3, it is given that all people who spend their free time tidying the house go to bed early.\n    - Now this creates two groups of possible behaviors:\n        * Group A) People with property (B), which also implies they work at home frequently and \n            as a result are tidy. They must sleep in before noon, otherwise there is no information given about them\n             going to the store or not being tidy.\n        \n6. Now let's evaluate Premise 4: If people visit office supply stores regularly then that means they have property (C).\n    - This premise gives us a relationship between visiting an office and working from home often.\n\n7. Next step, we take Remy having property A) going to bed late and waking after noon.\n   - Given the premises about being tidy leading sleeping early or not spending time at office supplies store regularly\n     this can only be possible if either they do not work frequently (contradicting premise 1)\n      or spend less than an hour tidying their home.\n\n8. Since Remy works from home often, visiting the supply store is one of two behaviors for them:\n   - We cannot say that they visit it because there are many premises which indicate a relationship between working and being tidy (premise 4).\n     However since all people who work regularly at home spend their time tidying in premise 3 \n       this indicates Remy must have either property A or B. \n\n9. Let's look into our final conclusion: If someone has property A) goes to bed late, wakes after noon OR visits the store often (property C), then they cannot be tidy.\n   - Since visiting an office is directly related with being regular at home workplace according to Premise 4\n     this indicates Remy can have only one of these two behaviors and we know from previous steps that property A) or B)\n       must apply for them.\n\n10. This makes it impossible for Remy having a fully stocked impressive office since owning an impressive \n    -office is directly linked with being tidy in premise 2.\n    \n11. Therefore, if they have the behavior of going to bed late and waking up after noon (A) OR visit the supply store regularly\n     then neither spending time tidying nor has property B which implies having a fully stocked office.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is A).",

All students who take the database course are from the computer science department and they are also instructed by professor David (from premises 4 and 1). Therefore, only students taking the database course can be both instructed by professor David and from the computer science department.\n4. Since James is a student working in the lab (and hence instructed by professor David), he must take the database course as well.\n5. From premise 3, all students who have part-time jobs offered by the university are students who work in the library. However there's no information that suggests these two groups overlap or intersect with any other group of people not taking a computer science class for their job (part time).\n6. Since James is also from the computer science department and has to take database course, he can be inferred as one such student working at the library.\n7. Given this line of reasoning it implies that only those who work in the lab are students taking a part-time university job offered by the University provided they're not Jack.\n\nHowever since James does indeed have a part time job which is working for him being from computer science department he doesn't contradict any statement about his employment status - however we do know jack isn't employed through premises so that's irrelevant to our problem.\n8. Therefore, given all of this information and the fact that there are no other students who could be taking a part-time job offered by university if they're not from computer science department (other than lab workers), it follows logically that James must work in library but since we don't have any statement that says he's working elsewhere - it means his employment status is consistent with him being at the library.\n\nHowever, to answer whether or not jame works for a university job outside of this information there are some inconsistencies within premises.\nBut overall from step 7 and knowing James has part time work as well as other facts in the problem statement we can deduce that he indeed must have an employment status with University even though it's stated elsewhere about lab workers.\n\n\nSince all these steps lead us to a point where jame does indeed seem like someone who could be taking university job, however  one thing left is - whether or not this conclusion follows directly from premises.\n\nFrom premise 3 we know students in library take jobs offered by University.\nAnd since James must work at the library as per step 6 because he's working in lab (instructed by Professor David) and only those taking database course are instructed by professor david. \nTherefore it can be concluded that - given all premises about computer science department, employment status etc., we should deduce whether or not jame works for university.\n\nFrom premise 3 which states students who take part time jobs from University must work in library.\nAnd since James does indeed seem to have taken database course and thus would be employed at the Library by Premise 2 (students working at the library are taking university offered part-time job), that implies he is an exception.",

From premise 5, we know that all students instructed by professor David are taking the database course.\n5. We also know (premise 6) that James is one of those who work in the lab, which means he's being taught by Professor David because everyone working in the lab is under his instruction.\n6. From step 4 and this new information about James' situation, we can conclude that since James works with professor David and given premise 5, then it must be true for him to take a database course as well.\n\n7. However, there's another option presented by the conclusion - 'has a part-time job offered by the university'. We've established in steps before this one (steps 1-3) that students working with library jobs aren't from computer science departments.\n8. This doesn't mean James can't have an outside job if it wasn't given to him through his school, so he might still work somewhere else.\n\n9.

We also know that all students who have part-time jobs offered by the university are students who work in the library. \n   Since Jack neither has a part-time job nor works in the lab (which is related to professor David), it can be inferred that he does not work in the library either.\n\n3. Given this information, we cannot directly conclude anything about Jack taking the database course from premises 1 and 2 alone.\n4. However, since James is working in a lab instructed by Professor David (from premise 5) and all students who take the database course are taught by professor David (premise 4), it can be inferred that some or many of those students also work with him at his lab.\n\n5. Since Jack does not have any known relationships to these groups, we still cannot directly conclude anything from premises about Jack taking a particular course.\n6. To make progress on the question asked in this problem (Jack’s involvement), let's look closer: \n   We do know that all students instructed by Professor David are taking the database course because of premise 4.\n\n7. This tells us there is an implication here for people working with him - those at his lab, to be more specific.\n8. And given that Jack neither works in a part-time job nor does he work in professor David’s lab (from premises), we still have no information linking the two directly and can't determine if Jack takes this course from these 2 facts alone.\n\n9. Since James is working with him at his lab, it would make sense to deduce that some people are involved indirectly because of their instructor affiliation - i.e., as students who take a class.\n10. Therefore we're not yet in position for the question asked on Jack’s situation but know he does work elsewhere.\n\n11. The next part will give us what is needed: We need information connecting James and his job (in lab) to an outcome about working with him which links into our premise 4.\n12. Let's think of it this way - if we can establish that students who take a class have one thing in common, then any other person doing something else should be compared against those premises.\n\n13. Now let’s look at the final statement:\n   Given Jack does not work with Professor David (from premise 6) and isn’t working part-time for university or library (premise 2), we can see he doesn't fit into our known groups based on information given here, since all other students are accounted.\n\n14. Since none of these premises show us an outcome about Jack taking a course taught by professor David because there's no link between those two facts alone.\n15. The premise \"Jack neither has a part-time job offered by the university nor works in the lab\" and others provide necessary information to rule out involvement directly via certain premises that were established previously.\n\n16. We can now conclude our thought process with one final step: \n   From these steps we have determined Jack doesn’t belong based on given data because he has a known outcome of not being part-time university staff nor working in the lab (which links professor David students).",

The conclusion states: \"If George likes music and has access to a program, he will compose.\"\n\n3. We need to determine the logical relationship between these premises and the conclusion by using the process of elimination or other reasoning techniques.\n\n4. Since all three original statements are 'if-then' conditional statements (also known as hypotheticals), we can use them in combination with each other through various logical operations such as conjunction, disjunction etc., but most importantly implication.\n\n5. We know that for a conclusion to be true given the premises, it must follow logically from at least one of the premises or from all the premises together when combined using appropriate logical operators like AND (conjunction).\n\n6. Looking closely, we can see that if George likes music and has access to a program then two out of three conditions mentioned in the conclusion are met i.e., he will want to compose because 'he wants to' is implied by premise one ('If George likes music, he wants to compose.') when combined with another condition 'if-then he can', which follows from premises 2.\n\n7. However there's a missing link as per original statements regarding the third part of this conclusion - \"He will compose\" - i.e., we need some statement that says if (he likes music) and (has access to program), then (will want + will be able). This is exactly what premise 1 ('If George likes music, he wants to compose.') combined with premise 2 does but this only covers the \"wants\" part. The 'can' condition of composing must still be met according to one more premises.\n\n8. Unfortunately for our current conclusion we cannot use Premise three because that says: If (George can + George Wants), then he will, which implies that there is a need for both conditions ('he wants to compose and he can') before 'he will compose' condition follows logically from this premise so the statement in premises 3 isn't enough.\n\n9. This would mean our conclusion cannot be determined with any level of certainty because it needs additional information - we don't know that George has access to a program if all other conditions are met i.e., he likes music and wants to compose which is what Premise three implies about the condition \"if both can & want\". \n\n10. Since there's not enough given in premises, conclusion cannot be logically deduced from these statements.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is Unknown",

To evaluate the conclusion: \"If George will not compose, George cannot compose,\" we need to check if it logically follows from the given premises or contradicts them.\n\n3. Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n   a) The first premise implies that liking music leads to wanting to compose.\n   b) If he wants to compose and has access to a program (second premise), then by the third premise, he will compose if all conditions are met.\n\n4. However, the conclusion \"If George will not compose, George cannot compose\" doesn't directly relate to any specific premises but rather tries to draw an inference from the opposite of one possible outcome mentioned in the third premise (\"he will compose\").\n\n5. Let's analyze this: \n   - The original statement says that if he can and wants to (i.e., all conditions are met), then he will.\n   But it does not state or imply that \"not composing\" would be due to an inability rather than lack of access, no desire, etc.\n\n6. So the conclusion attempts a reverse inference but doesn't necessarily follow from the premises because there's nothing in them stating that if George won't compose, then he can't compose; it only implies being able and wanting are necessary conditions for composing when they coexist.\n\n\n7. Based on this analysis:\n   - The original statements provide specific logical steps.\n   - However, \"If George will not compose\" does indeed imply the absence of one or more requirements mentioned in those premises (e.g., access to a program; desire).\n   \n8. Therefore, it's possible that if he won't compose due to any reason other than inability (like lack of interest), then this conclusion would still be true because there is no condition present which states otherwise.\n\n9. In light of the provided analysis:\n   - The statement \"If George will not compose, George cannot compose\" could indeed hold as a valid truth in specific scenarios but it's also possible that it may only apply to particular cases when inability causes the non-composition.\n   \n10.

Now let's return to our premise regarding 'Colorectal Cancer', since we've established that this condition cannot have a low survival rate and also not fit into classifications of Bile duct cancers or its variations, \n   We can conclude from Premise 2 (If something is a deadly disease then the Survival Rate will be Low) that if colorectal cancer were indeed classified under 'deadly diseases', it would lead to contradictions with information we know.\n\n8. Given this analysis in Step 7 and looking at our premises regarding cholangiocarcinoma, \n   We can make an educated guess about whether or not colorectal is a deadly disease based on the provided statements that all forms of Cholangiocarcinomas have low survival rates (being classified as 'deadly diseases').\n\n9. Since we know from Premise 2 and Step 8 analysis that cholangiocarcinoma has been established to be a type of deadly cancer, \n    Then its variations such as colorectal would not fit into the classification if they had low survival rates due to having contradictions with information provided by Premises.\n\n10. From Steps above we can infer from premise 2 (If something is a deadly disease then it's Survival rate will be Low) that since Colorectal has already been ruled out of 'Low' Survival Rate conditions, \n    Then it must not fall under classifications for being considered as 'deadly diseases'.\n\n11. Using Premise 1 we know if the survival rates are low in any condition classified under a deadly disease then those would indeed be categorized under that classification (Deadly Disease). Since this does apply to Colorectal from our previous deductions, \n    Then it follows logically using premise 2 and step 10 analysis above that colorectal is not considered as 'deadly diseases'.\n\n12. Based on Step 11 conclusion we now have enough information about whether or not the condition (Colorectal cancer) would be classified under a severe category since Premise 5 states \n    \"If Colorectal Cancer were indeed to fall into Deadly Diseases classification, then it cannot fit as Bile duct cancers but this has already been established as contradictions in our analysis. Therefore if we know that Cholangiocarcinoma and its variations have low survival rates from Step 8.\n\n13. We can now logically apply Premise 1 (If something is a deadly disease, then the Survival rate will be Low) to deduce information about Colorectal Cancer using steps above which showed us contradictions with Deadly Diseases classification when it comes to having 'low' survival Rates.\n   Therefore given this analysis in Steps and deductions from them we can establish whether or not colorectal cancer would fall under a severe category.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is B.",

From Premise 3:\nAll severe cancers are deadly diseases\nand \nBile duct cancer is a severe cancer,\nwe get by substitution in the previous conclusion: All bile duct cancers are deadly diseases, so their survival rate is also low.\n\nPremises 4 states that Bile duct cancer is a type of Cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer). Given this and Premise 3 we conclude all Cholangiocarcinomas have low survival rates as well. \n\nNext premise says: No one with mild flu has a low survival rate.\nThis tells us the opposite condition; that only people having deadly diseases are those with a low survival rate.\n\nFrom premises 5:\nIf colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer and the survival rate is low, then colorectal cancer is not a bile duct cancer,\nwe know by contrapositive of this premise: if it's actually a case where Colorectal Cancer can be classified as Bile Duct Cancer (it has to have some other condition like being deadly disease) we get an inconsistent result with Premise 5.\nHence, the only way for colorectal cancer not lead into contradiction is that when its survival rate isn't low.\n\nGiven all these facts and premises from above:\nWe can reason using modus tollens (if P then Q; Not Q therefore Not-P). \nIf something is a deadly disease or severe cancer it has to have a low survival rate, if it's not having the same low survival rate that means we should be able to get rid of \"deadly diseases\" condition for now and move towards Premises 6. This premise says: All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.\n\nSince all severe cancers are deadly diseases (Premise 2) so by Universal instantiation it follows Bile Duct Cancer must have low survival rate.\nAnd hence, given that Colorectal cancer can't be classified as a \"deadly disease\", we get rid of one condition in Premises conclusion and only keep the second part i.e., Cholangiocarcinoma.\n\nSo using modus tollens again from this fact with premise 2: All severe cancers are deadly diseases; if colorectal is not having low survival rate it must have a different type which leads us to \nBile duct Cancer, or in other words Colorectal cancer has been classified as Bile Duct Cancer.",

Let's denote \"A\" as something being a deadly disease, \n\"B\" as its survival rate is low,\n\"C\" as severe cancers are all deadly diseases.\nFrom the given information: A -> B (If X then Y) and C = A.\n\n2. From premise 3, we know that D (Bile duct cancer) is a type of E (Severe Cancer).\nSo from our previous step, \nD -> A (As severe cancers are all deadly diseases).\n\n3. We also have F (Cholangiocarcinoma) being equal to G (bile duct cancer), as mentioned in premise 4.\nF = G.\n\n4. Now we know D is a type of E and it's given that H (colorectal cancer) isn't directly related to these conditions, \nso there are no premises indicating H -> A or B, which means we can only determine if colorectal cancer has low survival rate by assuming the premise for H.\n\n5. We have one condition stating I (mild flu is not associated with a low survival rate), but it does not provide us information about its relation to deadly diseases.\nSo J = ~B and there's no direct connection between K (colorectal cancer) and L, which would indicate the type of disease.\n\n6. Finally from premise 5:\nH being G or B cannot be true as we have a condition stating that if H is both then it can't be classified under this category.\nThis implies: \n(H & (B or D)) -> ~(H = (G | B))\n\n7. From the conclusion, we're looking at \"M\" which states colorectal cancer isn't mild flu and also not Cholangiocarcinoma:\n~I && ~F\n\n8. We have a disjunctive premise that can be translated to: \n(M & ((D) or F)) is our goal.\n\n9. Using the information we derived from steps 4-6, it's evident that H (colorectal cancer), isn't G and B simultaneously.\nHence:\n~(H = (G | B))\n\n10. The conclusion states \"If colorectal cancer is not a mild flu and Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer or Cholangiocarcinoma.\"\nWhich in symbolic logic can be written as: \n(M -> ((D) or F))\nGiven M = ~I && ~F\nIt simplifies to:\n(~I & ~F) -> (D | F)\nFrom our previous steps we know D and F are the same.\n\nSo, (~I & ~F) -> F\n\n11.

This is True as it's been established that if colorectal cancer isn't a mild flu and Cholangiocarcinoma then \nit must necessarily fall under the category of being bile duct cancer (or simply put another term for it which we found out in step 3) or more precisely, its equivalent F.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is A.",

We are given two premises related to relationships between parents:\n    - If people have good relationships with their parents, then they fulfill their nutritional daily intakes.\n    - If people have good relationships with their parents, then they do not eat salads regularly.\n\n3. From the first premise (people who fulfilled nutritional requirements), we know that fulfilling those requires growing up in health-conscious homes and/or visiting the gym at least once a day. Since it's given as an alternative condition to eating salad (if you have good relationships with your parents) then if she didn't grow up in such home, her relationship with her parent wouldn’t be related to fulfillment of nutritional requirements.\n\n4. The second premise suggests that having a good relationship with one’s parents is not related to fulfilling daily intakes when they already eat salads regularly (not applicable here because it's either/or condition).\n\n5.

Given that Taylor has a good relationship with her parent(s) from premise 6 in combination of 7, this would mean she does indeed eats salads less often.\n4. Now looking at the premises related to growing up in health-conscious childhood homes and visiting the gym:\n   - If people have good relationships with their parents, then they fulfill their nutritional daily intakes (this implies a positive relationship between parent-child relationship and eating habits).\n5. From premise 8, it's given that if Taylor has good relationships with her parents she fulfills her nutritional daily intake.\n6. Now combining premises from steps 4 & 3: If people have good relationships with their parents, then they do not eat salads regularly (from step 2) and also fulfill their nutritional intakes (step 5). However this contradicts premise 9 which states that if people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.\n7. Given these premises it would be safe to conclude: If Taylor has good relationships with her parents she must either not eat salad regularly or does indeed go to the Gym (but this cannot both happen).\n8. Now combining premise 5 and our conclusion from step 2, we see that since it is true for a person who fulfills their nutritional daily intakes then grew up in health-conscious childhood homes; Taylor's case will be affected by either fulfilling her daily intake or not.\n9.

Now we know: \n  - If someone wears large shoes, they wear large-sized clothes.\n  Given this information and the fact that Yuri wears large shoes, it can be inferred that Yuri should also wear large-size clothes if the premises were complete regarding shoe size to clothing size relationship in general but here we don't have any direct or indirect evidence saying otherwise. However from premise YURI does not WEAR LARGE SIZE CLOTHES.\n\n4. This creates a contradiction with our previous conclusion (Yuri wears large shoes) because Yuri doesn’t wear large-size clothes, which is given directly as one of the premises.\n5. Since we have found a direct conflict in information provided and concluded Yuri shouldn't necessarily be expected to adhere to all those conditions based on general statements without explicit denial or confirmation regarding the specific case of YURI's condition from other available premises that could link shoe size with clothing, it cannot be determined if he is indeed not an American basketball player.\n\n6. Given this analysis we can conclude:\n- Yuri being a tall person wearing large shoes doesn't necessarily determine whether he wears large-size clothes.\n   - However given information in the problem does lead to conclusion about YURI's classification of which shoe size should match clothing size for any normal individual however here we are trying to solve an implication with premises.\n\n7. Given all this, let’s re-examine our premise:\n- If Yuri is not an American basketball player then he might be a non-American tall person who wears large shoes but does not wear large-size clothes which could mean YURI isn’t necessarily a Basketball Player because it was mentioned that some players aren't American and also we can see no evidence from premises provided to support the conclusion.\n\n8. Since Yuri doesn’t wear large-size clothes, he cannot be said for sure to follow all of those conditions given in other statements.\n- Hence our final answer regarding YURI being a basketball player remains unknown.\n\n\n\nAnswer: The final answer is C",

However, there's no explicit statement about all or most events being sad. The conclusion \"All events are sad\" contradicts the premise that some event(s) is/are happy.\n4. Based on these steps, we can deduce that if at least one event cannot be classified as 'happy', then it should fall into another category - which in this case would have to be 'sad' according to our binary system.\n\nHowever since there's a statement saying \"at least one\" is indeed happy, and the first premise says events are either sad or happy. Then we can say with certainty that not all of them could possibly be classified as only being 'happy'.

This implies that any dog will satisfy the first premise (bark), thus leading to Jane disliking dogs in general.\n\n3. However, there is another set of premises stating: \n    - If an animal jumps, then Jane likes it.\n    - And if an animal has legs, then it jumps.\n    \n4. This implies that any animal with legs will also satisfy the second premise (jump), thus leading to Jane liking animals with legs.\n\n5. Furthermore, there is another set of premises stating: \n    - If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs.\n6. So we can infer from this chain:\n   - Animal is Terricolous -> Has Legs\n   - And since any legged creature will jump (as per premise 2) and Jane likes jumping creatures,\n      a terriculous animal would satisfy both premises of liking.\n\n7. But there's also the case where KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then \n    it is stated that KiKi must be either Terricolous or have Legs.\n    \n8. Now let’s analyze what happens if we conclude that ‘KiKi barks and is a dog’:\n   - If KiKi is indeed a dog (and thus an animal), as per premise 2: All dogs are animals that bark, it will satisfy the first premise of liking Jane not like the creature.\n\n9. Now let's analyze what happens when we conclude 'KiKis does NOT have legs': \n    Since if an animal has no legs then according to premise 4 (If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs), it can only be either Terriculous OR legged.\n\n10. We know that the creature cannot jump because of the first condition in this premise; and thus we now have two possibilities for what kind of animal this could be.\n \n11. Based on our current conclusion 'barks', Jane will NOT like KiKi, which leads to a contradiction with premises about terriculous animals being liked by Jane.\n\n12. Therefore given all these conditions it's impossible that the creature can both bark (be dis-liked) and also have legs as per premise 4.\n \n13. However there is no information stating what would happen if KiKi barks but ISN'T a dog; we just know from our premises about dogs in general.\n\n14. Since we cannot conclude 'barks' while being 'dog', given all the conditions stated above, this conclusion can be ruled out as true or false.\n \n15. Based on step 2 and premise 1: All Dogs are animals that bark -> Jane does not like it\n    It is possible for KiKi to both bark AND NOT BE A DOG; we just don't have enough information from our premises.\n\nAnswer: The final answer is C (Unknown)",
