The probability of rolling one of these is 5/10 = 1/2 or 50%.\n\n2. **Probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row:** There are 5 odd numbers on a d10 die (1, 3, 5, 7, 9). The probability of rolling an odd number is 5/10 = 1/2. Since the rolls are independent events, we multiply probabilities together: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.\n\n3. **Difference in probability:**  The difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 5 and rolling two odd numbers is 50% - 25% = 25%.\n\n\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 25",

Since wheats are a rare treat, he only buys eight 3-kg boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the pigs while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys fourteen 6-kg bags.
