Since no managers can be working remotely based on Premise 6:\n    - If he's a manager and not appearing today (based on premise that only those scheduling customer meetings appear), then the statement about lunch does not apply since it says if they have lunch at home, but there is an additional condition where managers do NOT work from home.\n3. **For James in other countries:** He must be working remotely which aligns with having lunch at home (remote workers based on premises).\n4.

      "raw": " \\boxed{B}\n\nThe conclusion that \"Symptons of Monkeypox include coughing\" is not supported by the given premises. The provided symptoms do not list 'coughing' as one of them, and there's an error in mentioning a 'glu', which appears to be unrelated or perhaps a typo for something like 'flu'. Therefore, based on the information available from these premises alone, we cannot determine that coughing is indeed a symptom of Monkeypox. Hence, the conclusion should be considered false as it introduces new data not supported by the provided facts.",
