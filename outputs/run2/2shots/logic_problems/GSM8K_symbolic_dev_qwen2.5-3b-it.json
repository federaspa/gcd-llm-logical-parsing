Therefore, if his uncle was 21 years old then, Arash would be `4 * 21`.\n- To find out how many seconds passed between these two sightings of the comet (which is one full orbit), we calculate `(comet_orbit_years / 60) / 365`, as there are approximately 60 minutes in an hour and 365 days in a year.",
