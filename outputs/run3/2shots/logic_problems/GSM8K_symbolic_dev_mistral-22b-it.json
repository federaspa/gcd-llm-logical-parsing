      "question": "A farmer is buying feed for his cows. He buys a variety of apples, oats, beets and corns. Since corns are a rare treat, he only buys four 7-kg boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough beets to feed the cows while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys thirteen 6-kg bags. Apples are the main diet of his cows, so he buys thirty five 39-kg packs. Oats are a staple to supplement the apples, so he buys seventeen 17-kg sacks. If his farm truck can carry 160 kgs at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?",
