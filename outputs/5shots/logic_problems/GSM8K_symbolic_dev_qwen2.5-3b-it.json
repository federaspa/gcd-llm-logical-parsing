      "question": "Viktor is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pot of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 10 pop in the first 14 seconds of cooking, then 3 times that amount in the next 14 seconds. The kernels increase to 4 times the initial popping rate in the next 14 seconds, but in the final 14 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 14 seconds. After Viktor takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 14 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Viktor have to eat?",
