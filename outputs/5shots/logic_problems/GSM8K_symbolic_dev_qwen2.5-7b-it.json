      "question": "A farmer is buying feed for his sheep. He buys a variety of oats, apples, beets and wheats. Since wheats are a rare treat, he only buys six 7-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough beets to feed the sheep while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys thirteen 8-pound bags. Oats are the main diet of his sheep, so he buys thirty three 42-pound packs. Apples are a staple to supplement the oats, so he buys sixteen 18-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 130 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?",
