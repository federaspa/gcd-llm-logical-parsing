It's true that Sam works hard at least once every day and always plays music .\nIt can be determined whether someone does their job perfectly without having any knowledge about the situation.\nIf Rina has no relationship with her parents then she won't eat salads regularly.\n\nNL conclusion:\n\"\"\"\n∃x ∀!(Project(x) → Do(sam, x))\n\nHere's an explanation of how to convert this problem:\n\n* The predicates and constants used are identical in both natural language premises as well. \n\n### Third Example\nThe NL premise remains the same.\n \nHowever let’s add another predicate called \"Be\" that indicates whether someone is healthy or not.\n\nNL conclusion:\n\"\"\"\n∃x ∀!(Project(x) → Do(sam, x)) ∧ ∀y (Healthy(y))\n\nHere's an explanation of how to convert this problem:\n\n* The predicates and constants used are identical in both NL premises as well.",
