Liam has two extra classes, each lasting one hour per period and taking place on days he doesn't attend school (Saturday or Sunday). He spends an equal amount of time as his regular class sessions on both Saturday and Sunday, totaling about half the total hours spent learning per week.\n\nIn standard infix notation: \n- There are 6 periods in a normal day\n- Liam has two extra classes each period lasting one hour\n- Total school days = 2 (one for each of his two classes)\n- Time spent on Saturdays/Sundays = equal to half the time spent at regular class sessions\n\nIn this case, since there is only one week and he attends all weekdays:\nTotal time per weekday = periods * number_of_days - total_time_per_weeknight / 2\n= (6 days) * 7 weeks/day - ((total_time_per_weeknight / 2)) \n= (42 hours/week) - (15 hours/week)\n= 27 hours/week\n\nTime spent learning per weekday = time_spent_learning_per_day * number_of_days\n= 30 minutes/hour * days_per_weekday  \n= 30 minutes/day * 6 days \n= 180 minutes/week\n\nSo, Liam spends an average of about **27** hours each week studying at school.",

So, the number of laser tag sessions played by friends can be calculated as:\n   - Number_of_laser_tags_played = Budget / Cost_per_round\n- Pinball tokens cost 9 for each ride on roller coaster. The total cost is given in units of currency.\n- Number_of_pinballs_risked should also be converted into monetary form before performing the division calculation to find friends-to-invite:\n   - Number_of_pins_by_rolls = Budget / Cost_per_roll\n- Finally, calculate number of laser tags played by friends and divide it with cost per round for friend invitations.\n\nThis conversion is done in standard infix notation as follows:\n\nbudget -> ₣150  \nlaser_tag_cost_per_round -> 4 \npinball_tokens_cost_in_rolls -> (8 * 9 / 2) = 36\n\nfriends_to_invite = ((laser_tags_played - pinballs_risked) / laser_tag_cost_per_round)\nfriends_to_invite -> ₣150 / 4 - (36 / 4)\n\nThis step-by-step process follows the conversion rules provided.",
