      "question": "A farmer is buying feed for his cows. He buys a variety of apples, oats, beets and corns. Since corns are a rare treat, he only buys four 7-kg boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough beets to feed the cows while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys thirteen 6-kg bags. Apples are the main diet of his cows, so he buys thirty five 39-kg packs. Oats are a staple to supplement the apples, so he buys seventeen 17-kg sacks. If his farm truck can carry 160 kgs at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?",

Or just use a single variable with total skein calculation in the question field itself. This will be more efficient as we don't need to create unnecessary variables. But here I have provided both ways, you can choose any one based on your convenience. Also note that this is not standard infix notation but it helps us understand the problem better by breaking down each component into seperate expression. We are doing these calculations in this way because all the grandchildrens' sizes are same so we don't need to create different variables for them, instead multiply with the number of grandkids directly. And also to avoid repeating the multiplication operation for every item as it is common among them. So we can calculate total skeins needed for one kid and then multiply by 4 (number of kids). This way we save some computation power and reduce chances of error due to repeated operations. For standard infix notation, just replace '*' with 'times'. And remove the comments.

We assume 1 pound = 0.4536 kg (approximate conversion factor) and not 2.205 as provided by OP. Correcting this error here. This might be a typo from OP. If not, please clarify if the unit should remain pounds or converted to kilograms. Please note that using SI units is preferred in most scientific contexts. For simplicity, we can use kg instead of pounds for calculations without any loss in generality and accuracy. But this conversion factor seems incorrect here as 1 pound ~ 0.4536kg not 2.205. So the correct infix expression should be truck_weight = 2100 * 0.4536 instead of 2100*2.205, if we are using SI units here. But I will keep your unit as is for now and convert later to avoid any confusion at this point. If you want me to use kg or pounds please let me know so that I can make necessary corrections in my code accordingly before moving forward with the solution. Thank You!
