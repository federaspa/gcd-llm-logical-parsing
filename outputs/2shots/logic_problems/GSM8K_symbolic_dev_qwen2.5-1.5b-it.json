For the first part, we pay $0.8 per minute for each of the initial `min` minutes.\n  2. For the second part (from `minutes_after_25_minutes_price_drop`, which is after 25 minutes), we pay a reduced rate of $0.6 per minute on top of those remaining minutes.\n\nThe formula combines these two parts using standard infix notation:\n- `(min * phone_booth_fee)` represents paying for the initial duration.\n- `((max - min) / minutes_after_25_minutes_price_drop)` calculates how much we pay after 25 minutes, which is subtracted from the total call time.\n\nThis gives us a comprehensive and accurate representation of the cost calculation in standard infix notation.",
