Recognize the conditional statement \"If A, then B.\"\n2. Antecedent (A):\n   - \"People perform in school talent shows often\" translates to \"For all x, x performs in school talent shows often.\"\n   - Using predicate Performs(x): x performs in school talent shows often.\n3. Consequent (B):\n   - \"they attend and are very engaged with school events\" translates to \"For all x, x attends and is very engaged with school events.\"\n   - Using predicate Attends(x): x attends and is very engaged with school events.\n4. Formulate the FOL expression:\n   - ∀x (Performs(x) → Attends(x))\n\n### Premise 2\n\n\"People either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community.\"\n\nSteps to Convert:\n\n1. Recognize the use of \"either...or...\", implying an exclusive or.\n2. Using predicates:\n   - Performs(x): x performs in school talent shows often.\n   - Inactive(x): x is an inactive and disinterested member of their community.\n3. Use the exclusive or operator (⊕):\n   - Formulate the FOL expression: ∀x (Performs(x) ⊕ Inactive(x))\n\n### Premise 3\n\n\"If people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school.\"\n\nSteps to Convert:\n\n1. Recognize the conditional statement \"If A, then B.\"\n2. Antecedent (A):\n   - \"people chaperone high school dances\" translates to \"For all x, x chaperones high school dances.\"\n   - Using predicate Chaperones(x): x chaperones high school dances.\n3. Consequent (B):\n   - \"they are not students who attend the school\" translates to \"For all x, x is not a student who attends the school.\"\n   - Using predicate Student(x): x is a student who attends the school.\n   - Apply negation to Student(x): ¬Student(x)\n4. Formulate the FOL expression:\n   - ∀x (Chaperones(x) → ¬Student(x))\n\n### Premise 4\n\n\"All people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.\"\n\nSteps to Convert:\n\n1. Recognize that this is a universal affirmative statement.\n2. Translate \"All people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances\" to \"For all x, if x is an inactive and disinterested member of their community, then x chaperones high school dances.\"\n3. Using predicates:\n   - Inactive(x): x is an inactive and disinterested member of their community.\n   - Chaperones(x): x chaperones high school dances.\n4. Formulate the FOL expression: ∀x (Inactive(x) → Chaperones(x))\n\n### Premise 5\n\n\"All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.\"\n\nSteps to Convert:\n\n1. Recognize that this is a universal affirmative statement.\n2. Translate \"All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school\" to \"For all x, if x is a young child or teenager who wishes to further their academic career and educational opportunities, then x is a student who attends the school.\"\n3. Using predicates:\n   - YoungChildOrTeenager(x): x is a young child or teenager who wishes to further their academic career and educational opportunities.\n   - Student(x): x is a student who attends the school.\n4.

Recognize the structure: \"either (A and B) or neither A nor B,\" which is an exclusive or between two possibilities.\n2. First possibility:\n   - \"both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school\" translates to \"Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school.\"\n   - Using predicates:\n     - Attends(bonnie): Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events.\n     - Student(bonnie): Bonnie is a student who attends the school.\n   - Combined using conjunction: Attends(bonnie) ∧ Student(bonnie)\n3. Second possibility:\n   - \"neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school\" translates to the negation of the disjunction:\n     - ¬(Attends(bonnie) ∨ Student(bonnie))\n4.

LongVacation(x): x wants to have a long vacation.\n4. Love(x, y): x loves season y.\n5. Season(x): x represents a season.\n\n### Premises\n\n#### Premise 1:\n\"There are four seasons in a year: Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter.\"\n\nThis is a simple statement that doesn't involve any predicates directly related to the problem. However, we can represent it as:\n∀x (Season(x) → (x = Spring ⊕ x = Summer ⊕ x = Fall ⊕ x = Winter))\n\n#### Premise 2:\n\"All students who want to have a long vacation love summer the most.\"\n\nThis is a universal affirmative statement.\n1. Recognize that this is a universal affirmative statement.\n2. Translate \"All students who want to have a long vacation love summer the most\" to \"For all x, if x is a student and wants to have a long vacation, then x loves summer the most.\"\n3.

Recognize that this is a simple affirmative statement.\n2. Translate \"Emma's favorite season is summer\" to \"Emma loves summer.\"\n3. Using predicates:\n   - FavoriteSeason(emma, summer): emma's favorite season is summer.\n   - Since FavoriteSeason(x, y) = Love(x, y), we can use this instead.\n4. Formulate the FOL expression: FavoriteSeason(emma, Summer) → Love(emma, Summer)\n   - Simplified using the definition of FavoriteSeason: Love(emma, Summer)\n\n#### Premise 4:\n\"Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's.\"\n\nThis is a negative affirmative statement.\n1. Recognize that \"not the same\" implies an equivalence relation, but in the context of favorite seasons, it's better to use the negation of the FavoriteSeason predicate for comparison.\n2. Translate \"Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's\" to \"For all x, if x is Mia's favorite season, then x is not Emma's favorite season.\"\n3. Using predicates:\n   - FavoriteSeason(x, y): x's favorite season is y.\n4. Formulate the FOL expression:\n   - ∀x (FavoriteSeason(mia, x) → ¬FavoriteSeason(emma, x))\n\n#### Premise 5:\n\"James wants to have a long vacation.\"\n\nThis is a simple affirmative statement.\n1.

Formulate the FOL expression: FavoriteSeason(james, Fall) → Love(james, Fall)\n   - Simplified using the definition of FavoriteSeason: Love(james, Fall)\n\n### Final Formulation\n\nHere is the final formulation of the problem in First-Order Logic:\n\n∀x (Season(x) → (x = Spring ⊕ x = Summer ⊕ x = Fall ⊕ x = Winter))\n\n∀x ((Student(x) ∧ LongVacation(x)) → (Love(x, Summer) ∧ ∀y (Love(x, y) → y = Summer)))\n\nLove(emma, Summer)\n\n∀x (FavoriteSeason(mia, x) → ¬FavoriteSeason(emma, x))\n\nLongVacation(james)\n\nLove(james, Fall)\n\nNote: This formulation assumes that the favorite season of a person is unique, i.e., if a person loves two seasons, then they love one as the favorite season.

Translate to \"There exists an individual y such that y's favorite season is not the same as Emma's favorite season, and y's favorite season is spring.\"\n3. Using predicates:\n   - Favorite(x, y): x's favorite season is y.\n   - Same(x, y): x is the same as y.\n   - Season(y): y is a season.\n4. Formulate the FOL expression: ∃y ¬Same(y, Emma) ∧ Favorite(y, Spring)\n\nThis is the updated premise. Now, the NL premises and conclusion can be expressed in FOL as follows:\n\nPredicates:\n- Love(x, y): x loves y the most.\n- Favorite(x): x's favorite season is y.\n- Season(x): x is a season (e.g., Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter).\n- Student(x): x is a student.\n- Vacation(x): x wants to have a long vacation.\n- Same(x, y): x is the same as y.\n\n---\n\nPremises:\n1. ∃x ∃y ∃z ∃w (Season(x) ∧ Season(y) ∧ Season(z) ∧ Season(w) ∧ x = Spring ∧ y = Summer ∧ z = Fall ∧ w = Winter)\n2. ∀x (Student(x) ∧ Vacation(x) → Love(x, Summer))\n3. ∃x Favorite(Emma, Summer)\n4. ∃y ¬Same(y, Emma) ∧ Favorite(y, Spring)\n5. ∃x Vacation(x)\n\n---\n\nConclusion:\n∃x Favorite(Mia, Spring)"

This could be defined as a relation between a language family and a language, where y is within x if y belongs to x.\n\n### Step 5: Convert Premise 4\n\n\"French and Spanish are both Romance languages.\"\n\nThis is a simple statement that can be translated directly to:\n\n\"For all x, x is French or x is Spanish implies x is a Romance language.\"\n\nUsing the predicates defined in step 1:\n\nFormulate the FOL expression: ∀x (French(x) ∨ Spanish(x) → Romance(x))\n\nHowever, this translation is not entirely accurate, because we are stating that x being either French or Spanish implies it is a Romance language, when in fact we know that French and Spanish are Romance languages and we are trying to establish their relationship. A more accurate translation would be:\n\n\"French is a Romance language and Spanish is a Romance language.\"\n\nFormulate the FOL expression: French(x) ∧ Romance(x) ∧ Spanish(y) ∧ Romance(y)\n\n### Step 6: Convert Premise 5\n\n\"German is related to Spanish.\"\n\nThis is a simple statement that can be translated directly to:\n\n\"For all x and y, x is German and y is Spanish implies x is related to y.\"\n\nUsing the predicates defined in step 1:\n\nFormulate the FOL expression: ∀x ∀y (German(x) ∧ Spanish(y) → Related(x, y))\n\n### Step 7: Convert Premise 6\n\n\"Basque is not related to any other language.\"\n\nThis is a universal negative statement. We can translate it to:\n\n\"For all x and y, if x is Basque and y is a language, then x is not related to y.\"\n\nUsing the predicates defined in step 1:\n\nFormulate the FOL expression: ∀x ∀y (Basque(x) ∧ Language(y) → ¬Related(x, y))\n\n### Step 8: Convert Conclusion\n\n\"French is an Indo-European language.\"\n\nThis is a simple statement that can be translated directly to:\n\n\"For all x, x is French implies x is an Indo-European language.\"\n\nUsing the predicates defined in step 1:\n\nFormulate the FOL expression: ∀x (French(x) → IndoEuropean(x))\n\nHowever, this translation is not entirely accurate, because we are stating that x being French implies it is an Indo-European language, but we actually know that French is a Romance language and Romance languages are Indo-European languages, therefore a more accurate translation would be:\n\n\"French is a Romance language and all Romance languages are Indo-European languages.\"\n\nFormulate the FOL expression: French(x) ∧ Romance(x) ∧ ∀y (Romance(y) → IndoEuropean(y))\n\n### Combining the FOL expressions\n\nWe now have the following FOL expressions:\n\n1. ∀x (Romance(x) → IndoEuropean(x))\n2. ∀x (Romance(x) → Family(x))\n3. ∀x ∀y (Family(x) ∧ Language(y) ∧ Within(x, y) → Related(x, y))\n4. French(x) ∧ Romance(x) ∧ Spanish(y) ∧ Romance(y)\n5. ∀x ∀y (German(x) ∧ Spanish(y) → Related(x, y))\n6. ∀x ∀y (Basque(x) ∧ Language(y) → ¬Related(x, y))\n7. ∀x (French(x) → IndoEuropean(x))\n\nThese can be combined to prove the conclusion.\n\nHowever, it seems that we still need to define the \"Within\" predicate and the relation between a language family and its member languages. Additionally, we have two statements that imply the existence of Romance languages (Premise 2 and Premise 4), but we have no statement that guarantees the existence of Romance languages. These issues need to be addressed in the FOL translation."

Formulate the FOL expression: ∀x (Striker(x) → Player(x))\n\n### Premise 3:\n\"Robert Lewandowski left Bayern Munchen.\"\n\nSteps to Convert:\n\n1.

Formulate the FOL expression: Leaves(robert_lewandowski, bayern_munchen)\n\n### Premise 4:\n\"If a player left a team they no longer play for that team.\"\n\nSteps to Convert:\n\n1. Recognize the conditional statement: if A then B, where A is \"a player left a team\" and B is \"no longer play for that team\".\n2. Break down the antecedent (A):\n   - \"a player left a team\":\n     - Using predicates:\n       - Leaves(x, y): x left team y.\n       - Team(y): y is a team.\n     - Formulate the FOL expression: ∃x (Leaves(x, y) ∧ Team(y))\n3.

Combine the antecedent and the consequent using the implication operator (→):\n   - (∃x (Leaves(x, y) ∧ Team(y)) → ¬Plays(x, y))\n\nHowever, we need to formulate this FOL expression for the specific case, where x = robert_lewandowski and y = bayern_munchen.\n\n   - Formulate the FOL expression for the specific case: (∃x (Leaves(robert_lewandowski, x) ∧ Team(x)) → ¬Plays(robert_lewandowski, bayern_munchen))\n\n### Conclusion:\n\"Robert Lewandowski plays for Bayern Munchen.\"\n\nSteps to Convert:\n\n1. Recognize that this is an affirmation statement about an entity (Robert Lewandowski) and a specific fact (playing for Bayern Munchen).\n2. Formulate the FOL expression using the predicate Plays(x, y): Plays(robert_lewandowski, bayern_munchen)\n\nTo connect the premises with the conclusion, we'll need to find a way to link the fact that Robert Lewandowski left Bayern Munchen to the conclusion that he plays for Bayern Munchen. The implication in Premise 4 suggests that if a player left a team, they no longer play for that team. However, we need to reverse this implication to arrive at the conclusion.\n\nSince Robert Lewandowski left Bayern Munchen, we can apply the implication to conclude that he no longer plays for Bayern Munchen. But then, we can also apply the implication again, since the conclusion is actually that he plays for Bayern Munchen.\n\n### Combined FOL Expression:\n\nThe conclusion can be linked to the premises using the following FOL expression:\n\n- (∃x (Leaves(robert_lewandowski, x) ∧ Team(x)) → ¬Plays(robert_lewandowski, bayern_munchen)) → Plays(robert_lewandowski, bayern_munchen)\n\nHowever, this is not the correct FOL expression. We need to apply the contrapositive of Premise 4 to conclude that since Robert Lewandowski no longer plays for Bayern Munchen, he plays for Bayern Munchen.\n\nThe correct FOL expression for the conclusion is simply: Plays(robert_lewandowski, bayern_munchen)\n\nTherefore, the correct combined FOL expression is:\n\n∀x (Striker(x) → Player(x)) ∧ Leaves(robert_lewandowski, bayern_munchen) ∧ (∃x (Leaves(robert_lewandowski, x) ∧ Team(x)) → ¬Plays(robert_lewandowski, bayern_munchen)) → Plays(robert_lewandowski, bayern_munchen)\n\nThis is not the correct FOL expression. The correct one should be formulated using the contrapositive of Premise 4, as follows:\n\n∀x (Striker(x) → Player(x)) ∧ Leaves(robert_lewandowski, bayern_munchen) ∧ ¬(¬Plays(robert_lewandowski, bayern_munchen)) → Plays(robert_lewandowski, bayern_munchen)\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\n∀x (Striker(x) → Player(x)) ∧ Leaves(robert_lewandowski, bayern_munchen) ∧ Plays(robert_lewandowski, bayern_munchen) → Plays(robert_lewandowski, bayern_munchen)\n\nHowever, this expression is not the correct one, since we are applying the antecedent twice in the FOL expression.\n\nThe correct FOL expression should be formulated using the contrapositive of Premise 4, and then the expression should be simplified to arrive at the correct one.\n\nThe correct FOL expression for the conclusion is:\n\nPlays(robert_lewandowski, bayern_munchen)\n\nThe correct combined FOL expression is:\n\n∀x (Striker(x) → Player(x)) ∧ Leaves(robert_lewandowski, bayern_munchen) \n\nWe have finished the conversion of the NL premises and conclusion into FOL expressions."

Formulate the FOL expression: Pet(ted)\n\nHowever, we cannot directly conclude that Ted is a pet. We need to use the premises to derive this conclusion. Let's analyze the premises:\n\n- Premise 3 implies that all bovines are domesticated, which means that since Ted is not a domesticated animal (Premise 4), Ted cannot be a bovine.\n- Premise 2 implies that there are pets that are cows, and since Premise 1 implies that all cows are bovines, this means that all cows are domesticated and cannot be alligators. Since Ted is an alligator (Premise 5), he must not be a cow.\n\nHowever, we still need to connect Ted to being a pet. We can try to use the fact that if Ted is not a bovine and not a cow, he might not be a domesticated animal. But we already have a premise that says no domesticated animals are alligators (Premise 4), which means that Ted cannot be a domesticated animal.\n\nThis leads us to a contradiction: Ted is an alligator (Premise 5) and cannot be a domesticated animal. But Premise 3 implies that all bovines are domesticated, which means that if Ted is not a domesticated animal, he cannot be a bovine. But Premise 1 implies that all cows are bovines, which means that if Ted is not a domesticated animal, he cannot be a cow.\n\nHowever, this is where our FOL expressions come into play. We can analyze the possible FOL expressions that would lead to this conclusion:\n\n- Ted is a pet: Pet(ted)\n- Ted is not a bovine: ¬Bovine(ted)\n- Ted is not a cow: ¬Cow(ted)\n- Ted is not a domesticated animal: ¬Domesticated(ted)\n- Ted is an alligator: Alligator(ted)\n\nUsing our FOL expressions, we can derive the conclusion:\n\nPet(ted) can be derived using the premises, but it requires more complex FOL expressions that involve the other predicates. Let's try to analyze how to connect the predicates:\n\n- Since Ted is not a domesticated animal (Premise 4), we know that ¬Domesticated(ted)\n- Since all domesticated animals are either bovines or cows (Premise 3), we know that ¬(Domesticated(ted) ∧ Bovine(ted)) and ¬(Domesticated(ted) ∧ Cow(ted))\n- Since Ted is an alligator (Premise 5), we know that Alligator(ted)\n- Since no domesticated animals are alligators (Premise 4), we know that ¬(Domesticated(ted) ∧ Alligator(ted))\n- From the above, we can conclude that Ted is not a domesticated animal and is not a bovine or a cow.\n\nHowever, this is where our FOL expressions come into play. We can analyze the possible FOL expressions that would lead to this conclusion:\n\n- Pet(ted) can be derived using the FOL expression:\n  ¬(Domesticated(ted) ∧ Alligator(ted)) ∧ (¬Bovine(ted) ∨ ¬Cow(ted)) → Pet(ted)\n\nBut this FOL expression is not a direct conclusion. We can simplify the FOL expression by using the other premises. Let's analyze how to connect the predicates:\n\n- From the premises, we know that:\n  - Alligator(ted) (Premise 5)\n  - ¬Domesticated(ted) (Premise 4)\n  - ¬(Domesticated(ted) ∧ Alligator(ted)) (Premise 4)\n  - ∀x (Bovine(x) → Domesticated(x)) (Premise 3)\n  - ∀x (Cow(x) → Bovine(x)) (Premise 1)\n\nUsing these premises, we can derive the FOL expression:\n\n∀x (Bovine(x) → Domesticated(x)) ∧ ∀x (Cow(x) → Bovine(x)) ∧ ¬(Domesticated(ted) ∧ Alligator(ted)) ∧ Alligator(ted) → Pet(ted)\n\nSimplifying this FOL expression, we get:\n\n¬(Domesticated(ted) ∧ Alligator(ted)) ∧ Alligator(ted) → Pet(ted)\n\nFrom this FOL expression, we can conclude that Ted is a pet:\n\n¬(Domesticated(ted) ∧ Alligator(ted)) ∧ Alligator(ted) → Pet(ted)"

Recognize that this is an existential statement.\n2. Translate \"Some stocks of some companies are growth stocks of companies\" to \"There exists an x such that x is a stock of a company and x is a growth stock of a company.\"\n3. Using predicates:\n   - StockOfCompany(x): x is a stock of a company.\n   - GrowthStockOfCompany(x): x is a growth stock of a company.\n4. Formulate the FOL expression: ∃x (StockOfCompany(x) ∧ GrowthStockOfCompany(x))\n\nPremise 4:\n\"All stocks of mature companies are suitable for a retirement fund.\"\n\nSteps to Convert:\n1. Recognize that this is a universal affirmative statement.\n2.

Using predicates:\n   - StockOfMatureCompany(x): x is a stock of a mature company.\n   - SuitableForRetirementFund(x): x is suitable for a retirement fund.\n4. We already have the predicate MatureCompany(x), so we need to rephrase the premise:\n   - MatureCompany(x) is equivalent to \"x is a mature company.\"\n   - StockOf(x): x is a stock of x (Note: This predicate is not in our list, but it is implied here)\n   - Combine StockOfMatureCompany(x) using conjunction: MatureCompany(x) ∧ StockOf(x)\n5. Formulate the FOL expression: ∀x (MatureCompany(x) ∧ StockOf(x) → SuitableForRetirementFund(x))\n\nHowever, we need to rephrase StockOfMatureCompany(x) to use the already defined predicates:\n- StockOfCompany(x): x is a stock of a company.\n- MatureCompany(x): x is a mature company.\n- Combine StockOfCompany(x) and MatureCompany(x) using conjunction: StockOfCompany(x) ∧ MatureCompany(x)\n\nThus, the correct FOL expression for this premise is:\n- ∀x ((StockOfCompany(x) ∧ MatureCompany(x)) → SuitableForRetirementFund(x))\n\nPremise 5:\n\"KO is a stock of a mature company.\"\n\nSteps to Convert:\n1. Recognize that this is an atomic statement.\n2. Using predicates:\n   - StockOfCompany(x): x is a stock of a company.\n   - MatureCompany(x): x is a mature company.\n3. Formulate the FOL expression: StockOfCompany(KO) ∧ MatureCompany(KO)\n\nNow, let's convert the conclusion into a First-Order Logic expression.\n\nConclusion:\n\"KO is a company stock and a growth stock of a company.\"\n\nSteps to Convert:\n1. Recognize that this is an atomic statement.\n2. Using predicates:\n   - StockOfCompany(x): x is a stock of a company.\n   - GrowthStockOfCompany(x): x is a growth stock of a company.\n3.

We need to define predicates that capture the meaning of the given natural language statements.\n\nHere are the predicates we can define:\n\n*   `LovedByTourists(x)`: x is loved by tourists.\n*   `FavoriteOfMax(x)`: x is Max's favorite animal.\n*   `Australian(x)`: x is an animal from Australia.\n*   `Fluffy(x)`: x is very fluffy.\n*   `Sleeps(x)`: x loves to sleep.\n*   `Koala(x)`: x is a koala.\n*   `Quokka(x)`: x is a quokka.\n\n### Step 2: Convert Premise 1 to FOL\n\nP1: \"If animals are loved by tourists, then they are Max's favorite animals.\"\n\nThis is a conditional statement. We can convert it to FOL as follows:\n\n1. Recognize the conditional statement \"If A, then B.\"\n2. Antecedent (A):\n    - \"Animals are loved by tourists.\"\n    - Combined using the `LovedByTourists(x)` predicate: `LovedByTourists(x)`\n3. Consequent (B):\n    - \"They are Max's favorite animals.\"\n    - Combined using the `FavoriteOfMax(x)` predicate: `FavoriteOfMax(x)`\n4. Formulate the FOL expression:\n    - `∀x (LovedByTourists(x) → FavoriteOfMax(x))`\n\n### Step 3: Convert Premise 2 to FOL\n\nP2: \"All animals from Australia are loved by tourists.\"\n\nThis is a universal statement. We can convert it to FOL as follows:\n\n1. Recognize the universal statement \"All x, P(x)\"\n2. Using predicates:\n    - `Australian(x)`: x is an animal from Australia.\n    - `LovedByTourists(x)`: x is loved by tourists.\n3. Formulate the FOL expression:\n    - `∀x (Australian(x) → LovedByTourists(x))`\n\n### Step 4: Convert Premise 3 to FOL\n\nP3: \"All quokka are animals from Australia.\"\n\nThis is a universal statement. We can convert it to FOL as follows:\n\n1. Recognize the universal statement \"All x, P(x)\"\n2. Using predicates:\n    - `Quokka(x)`: x is a quokka.\n    - `Australian(x)`: x is an animal from Australia.\n3. Formulate the FOL expression:\n    - `∀x (Quokka(x) → Australian(x))`\n\n### Step 5: Convert Premise 4 to FOL\n\nP4: \"All of Max's favorite animals are very fluffy.\"\n\nThis is a universal statement. We can convert it to FOL as follows:\n\n1. Recognize the universal statement \"All x, P(x)\"\n2. Using predicates:\n    - `FavoriteOfMax(x)`: x is Max's favorite animal.\n    - `Fluffy(x)`: x is very fluffy.\n3. Formulate the FOL expression:\n    - `∀x (FavoriteOfMax(x) → Fluffy(x))`\n\n### Step 6: Convert Premise 5 to FOL\n\nP5: \"All of Max's favorite animals love to sleep.\"\n\nThis is a universal statement. We can convert it to FOL as follows:\n\n1. Recognize the universal statement \"All x, P(x)\"\n2. Using predicates:\n    - `FavoriteOfMax(x)`: x is Max's favorite animal.\n    - `Sleeps(x)`: x loves to sleep.\n3. Formulate the FOL expression:\n    - `∀x (FavoriteOfMax(x) → Sleeps(x))`\n\n### Step 7: Convert Premise 6 to FOL\n\nP6: \"If a koala is very fluffy, then the koala is not a quokka.\"\n\nThis is a conditional statement. We can convert it to FOL as follows:\n\n1. Recognize the conditional statement \"If A, then B.\"\n2. Antecedent (A):\n    - \"A koala is very fluffy.\"\n    - Using predicates:\n        - `Koala(x)`: x is a koala.\n        - `Fluffy(x)`: x is very fluffy.\n3. Consequent (B):\n    - \"The koala is not a quokka.\"\n    - Using predicates:\n        - `Koala(x)`: x is a koala.\n        - `Quokka(x)`: x is a quokka.\n4. Negate the predicate `Quokka(x)` to obtain the negation of the consequent:\n    - `¬Quokka(x)`\n5. Formulate the FOL expression:\n    - `∀x (Koala(x) ∧ Fluffy(x) → ¬Quokka(x))`\n\n### Step 8: Convert Conclusion to FOL\n\nC: \"Koalas love to sleep.\"\n\nThis is an existential statement. We can convert it to FOL as follows:\n\n1. Recognize the existential statement \"∃x P(x)\"\n2. Using predicates:\n    - `Koala(x)`: x is a koala.\n    - `Sleeps(x)`: x loves to sleep.\n3. Formulate the FOL expression:\n    - `∃x (Koala(x) ∧ Sleeps(x))`\n\nTherefore, the converted FOL problem is as follows:\n\n- Predicates: \n  - `LovedByTourists(x)`: x is loved by tourists.\n  - `FavoriteOfMax(x)`: x is Max's favorite animal.\n  - `Australian(x)`: x is an animal from Australia.\n  - `Fluffy(x)`: x is very fluffy.\n  - `Sleeps(x)`: x loves to sleep.\n  - `Koala(x)`: x is a koala.\n  - `Quokka(x)`: x is a quokka.\n\n- Premises:\n  - `∀x (LovedByTourists(x) → FavoriteOfMax(x))`\n  - `∀x (Australian(x) → LovedByTourists(x))`\n  - `∀x (Quokka(x) → Australian(x))`\n  - `∀x (FavoriteOfMax(x) → Fluffy(x))`\n  - `∀x (FavoriteOfMax(x) → Sleeps(x))`\n  - `∀x (Koala(x) ∧ Fluffy(x) → ¬Quokka(x))`\n\n- Conclusion:\n  - `∃x (Koala(x) ∧ Sleeps(x))`\n\nThis is the converted FOL problem."

Recognize that this is a universal affirmative statement.\n2. Translate \"It costs US $205 to take the GRE test\" to \"For all x, x costs 205 dollars to take the GRE test.\"\n3. Using predicates:\n   - `Costs(x, y)`: x costs y dollars.\n   - `GRETest()`: taking the GRE test\n4. Formulate the FOL expression: ∀x (x takes GRETest() → Costs(x, 205))\n\n### Premise 2:\n\"ETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.\"\n\nSteps to Convert:\n1. Recognize the structure of the statement: \"A provides B to those C who satisfy D.\"\n2. Translate to \"For all x, if x is a GRE applicant and x has economic hardship, then x can apply for financial aid from ETS.\"\n3. Using predicates:\n   - `ETS()`: ETS\n   - `Applicant(x)`: x is a GRE applicant.\n   - `Hardship(x)`: x has economic hardship.\n   - `FinancialAid(x)`: x can apply for financial aid from ETS.\n4. Formulate the FOL expression: ∀x (Applicant(x) ∧ Hardship(x) → FinancialAid(x))\n\n### Premise 3:\n\"Economic hardship refers to difficulty caused by having too little money or too few resources.\"\n\nSteps to Convert:\n1. Recognize that this is a statement describing the meaning of economic hardship.\n2. We can use a predicate to represent economic hardship, but we don't need a specific FOL expression for this statement.\n\n### Premise 4:\n\"Tom lives in a single-parent family.\"\n\nSteps to Convert:\n1. Recognize that this is a statement about Tom.\n2. Using the `SingleParentFamily` predicate:\n   - `Tom`: Tom\n   - `SingleParentFamily(x)`: x lives in a single-parent family\n3. Formulate the FOL expression: SingleParentFamily(Tom)\n\n### Premise 5:\n\"His dad has been out of work for more than a year.\"\n\nSteps to Convert:\n1. Recognize that this is a statement about Tom's dad.\n2. Using the `Jobless` predicate:\n   - `Tom'sDad`: Tom's dad\n   - `Jobless(y, z)`: y has been out of work for more than z years\n3. Formulate the FOL expression: Jobless(Tom'sDad, 1)\n\n### Conclusion:\n\"Tom can apply for financial aid from ETS to take the GRE test.\"\n\nSteps to Convert:\n1. Recognize that we need to establish the relationship between Tom and financial aid.\n2. We can use the `FinancialAid` predicate, but we need to establish that Tom has economic hardship.\n3. From the premises, we have `Tom lives in a single-parent family` and `His dad has been out of work for more than a year`, which implies economic hardship.\n4. Formulate the FOL expression: FinancialAid(Tom)\n\nThe complete FOL expression would be:\n\n∀x (x takes GRETest() → Costs(x, 205))\n∀x (Applicant(x) ∧ Hardship(x) → FinancialAid(x))\nSingleParentFamily(Tom)\nJobless(Tom'sDad, 1)\nFinancialAid(Tom)"

Using Premise 2, we know that if Ben is funny, then he is popular (since being funny implies popularity).\n3.  However, we cannot directly infer that Ben is loved by children from this information.\n4.  To derive that Ben is loved by children, we need to use Premises 3 and 4 in conjunction.\n5.  Premise 3 states that a cartoon character loved by children is funny, while Premise 4 states that a cartoon character from The Simpsons is loved by children.\n6.  Combining these two premises, we can infer that Ben is loved by children, as he must be either from The Simpsons or funny (from Premise 6).\n7.  Hence, the FOL expression that represents the conclusion is:\n   - LovedByChildren(ben)\n\nTherefore, the final FOL expression is:\n\n∀x (Funny(x) → Popular(x))\n∀x (Ugly(x) → ¬Popular(x))\n∀x (LovedByChildren(x) → Funny(x))\n∀x (FromTheSimpsons(x) → LovedByChildren(x))\n∀x (Yellow(x) → FromTheSimpsons(x))\nFromTheSimpsons(ben) ⊕ Funny(ben)\nLovedByChildren(ben)\n\nNote that the universal quantifier (∀) is used for all predicates in the premises and conclusion."

      "reasoning": "To convert this problem into First-Order Logic, we need to follow the steps as described in the example. Let's proceed step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Define the predicates**\n\n1. Publishes(x, y): x is a publishing house that publishes y.\n2. Published(x): x is a book published by the publishing house.\n3. InEnglish(x): x is in English.\n4. Translated(x, y): x was translated from y.\n5. PublishedBy(x, y): x is published by y.\n\n**Step 2: Convert Premise 1 to FOL expression**\n\n1. Recognize that this is a universal affirmative statement.\n2. Translate \"New Vessel Press is a publishing house which specializes in translating foreign literature into English\" to \"For all x, if x is a publishing house, then x specializes in translating foreign literature into English.\"\n3. Using predicates:\n   - Publishes(x, y): x is a publishing house that publishes y.\n   - InEnglish(x): x is in English.\n   - SpecializesIn(x): x specializes in translating foreign literature into English.\n4. Formulate the FOL expression:\n   - ∀x (Publishes(x) → SpecializesIn(x))\n\nNote: However, the statement is actually about New Vessel Press's specialization and foreign literature. So, a more accurate translation would be:\n   - ∀x (Publishes(x) ∧ x = NewVesselPress → SpecializesIn(x, foreignLiterature))\n\nHowever, since we cannot assume we know the name \"NewVesselPress\" (which could be another variable) a more precise translation would be:\n   - ∀x (Publishes(x) ∧ x = NewVesselPress → SpecializesIn(x, foreignLanguage)) → SpecializesIn(NewVesselPress, foreignLanguage)\n   - where foreignLanguage is a predicate that represents a language (not \"foreignLiterature\" as this was not defined in the predicates). \n   - However, given the context, it might be reasonable to assume that this represents a specialization in translating languages other than English, hence \"foreignLanguage\".\n\n**Step 3: Convert Premise 2 to FOL expression**\n\n1. Recognize that this is a universal affirmative statement.\n2. Translate \"All of New Vessel Press's published books are in English\" to \"For all x, if x is a book published by New Vessel Press, then x is in English.\"\n3. Using predicates:\n   - Publishes(NewVesselPress, x): x is a book published by New Vessel Press.\n   - InEnglish(x): x is in English.\n4. Formulate the FOL expression:\n   - ∀x (Publishes(NewVesselPress, x) → InEnglish(x))\n\n**Step 4: Convert Premise 3 to FOL expression**\n\n1. Recognize that \"Neapolitan Chronicles is a book published by New Vessel Press\" translates to \"Neapolitan Chronicles is a published book and it was published by New Vessel Press\".\n2. Using predicates:\n   - Published(Book): Book is a published book.\n   - Publishes(NewVesselPress, Book): Book is a book published by NewVesselPress\n3. Formulate the FOL expression:\n   - Published(Book) ∧ Publishes(NewVesselPress, Book)\n\n**Step 5: Convert Premise 4 to FOL expression**\n\n1. Recognize that \"Neapolitan Chronicles was translated from Italian\" translates to \"There is a book x such that x is translated from Italian and x = Neapolitan Chronicles\".\n2. Using predicates:\n   - Translated(x, Italian): x is translated from Italian.\n   - Book(x): x is a book.\n3. Formulate the FOL expression:\n   - ∃x (Translated(x, Italian) ∧ x = NeapolitanChronicles)\n\n**Step 6: Convert Premise 5 to FOL expression**\n\n1. Recognize that \"Palace of Flies is a book published by New Vessel Press\" translates to \"Palace of Flies is a published book and it was published by New Vessel Press\".\n2. Using predicates:\n   - Published(Book): Book is a published book.\n   - Publishes(NewVesselPress, Book): Book is a book published by NewVesselPress\n3. Formulate the FOL expression:\n   - Published(PalaceOfFlies) ∧ Publishes(NewVesselPress, PalaceOfFlies)\n\n**Step 7: Formulate the FOL expression for the conclusion**\n\n1. Recognize the use of the conclusion \"Harry Potter was published by New Vessel Press\" implies \"Harry Potter is a published book and it was published by New Vessel Press\".\n2. Using predicates:\n   - Published(HarryPotter): Harry Potter is a published book.\n   - Publishes(NewVesselPress, HarryPotter): Harry Potter was published by New Vessel Press\n3. Formulate the FOL expression:\n   - Published(HarryPotter) ∧ Publishes(NewVesselPress, HarryPotter)"

      "reasoning": "To convert the given natural language reasoning problem into First-Order-Logic (FOL), we follow these steps.\n\n### Step 1: Define Predicates\n\nFirst, we need to define the predicates based on the given information. Here are the predicates for this problem:\n\n*   `Student(x)`: x is a student.\n*   `WorksInLibrary(x)`: x works in the library.\n*   `FromComputerScienceDepartment(x)`: x is from the computer science department.\n*   `PartTimeJobUniversity(x)`: x has a part-time job offered by the university.\n*   `Lab(x)`: x works in the lab.\n*   `DatabaseCourse(x)`: x is taking the database course.\n*   `InstructedByDavid(x)`: x is instructed by professor David.\n*   `PartOf(x, y)`: x is part of y (this predicate will be used later).\n\n### Step 2: Convert NL Premises to FOL Rules\n\nNow, we convert each premise into FOL rules.\n\n#### Premise 1:\n\"No students who work in the library are from the computer science department.\"\n\n1.  Recognize that this is a universal negative statement.\n2.  Translate to \"For all x, if x works in the library, then x is not from the computer science department.\"\n3.  Using predicates:\n    *   `WorksInLibrary(x)`: x works in the library.\n    *   `FromComputerScienceDepartment(x)`: x is from the computer science department.\n4.  Formulate the FOL expression: ∀x (WorksInLibrary(x) → ¬FromComputerScienceDepartment(x))\n\n#### Premise 2:\n\"All students who have part-time jobs offered by the university are students who work in the library.\"\n\n1.  Recognize that this is a universal affirmative statement.\n2.  Translate to \"For all x, if x has a part-time job offered by the university, then x works in the library.\"\n3.  Using predicates:\n    *   `PartTimeJobUniversity(x)`: x has a part-time job offered by the university.\n    *   `WorksInLibrary(x)`: x works in the library.\n4.  Formulate the FOL expression: ∀x (PartTimeJobUniversity(x) → WorksInLibrary(x))\n\n#### Premise 3:\n\"All students who take the database course are from the computer science department.\"\n\n1.  Recognize that this is a universal affirmative statement.\n2.  Translate to \"For all x, if x is taking the database course, then x is from the computer science department.\"\n3.  Using predicates:\n    *   `DatabaseCourse(x)`: x is taking the database course.\n    *   `FromComputerScienceDepartment(x)`: x is from the computer science department.\n4.  Formulate the FOL expression: ∀x (DatabaseCourse(x) → FromComputerScienceDepartment(x))\n\n#### Premise 4:\n\"All students instructed by professor David are taking the database course.\"\n\n1.  Recognize that this is a universal affirmative statement.\n2.  Translate to \"For all x, if x is instructed by professor David, then x is taking the database course.\"\n3.  Using predicates:\n    *   `InstructedByDavid(x)`: x is instructed by professor David.\n    *   `DatabaseCourse(x)`: x is taking the database course.\n4.  Formulate the FOL expression: ∀x (InstructedByDavid(x) → DatabaseCourse(x))\n\n#### Premise 5:\n\"All students working in the lab are instructed by professor David.\"\n\n1.  Recognize that this is a universal affirmative statement.\n2.  Translate to \"For all x, if x is working in the lab, then x is instructed by professor David.\"\n3.  Using predicates:\n    *   `Lab(x)`: x is working in the lab.\n    *   `InstructedByDavid(x)`: x is instructed by professor David.\n4.  Formulate the FOL expression: ∀x (Lab(x) → InstructedByDavid(x))\n\n#### Premise 6:\n\"James is a student working in the lab.\"\n\n1.  Translate to \"James is a student and James is working in the lab.\"\n2.  Using predicates:\n    *   `Student(x)`: x is a student.\n    *   `Lab(x)`: x is working in the lab.\n3.  Formulate the FOL expression: Student(james) ∧ Lab(james)\n\n#### Premise 7:\n\"Jack neither has a part-time job offered by the university nor works in the lab.\"\n\n1.  Translate to \"Jack is not a student who has a part-time job offered by the university, and Jack is not a student who works in the lab.\"\n2.  Using predicates:\n    *   `PartTimeJobUniversity(x)`: x has a part-time job offered by the university.\n    *   `Lab(x)`: x works in the lab.\n3.  Formulate the FOL expression: ¬(PartTimeJobUniversity(jack) ∨ Lab(jack))\n\n### Step 3: Convert NL Conclusion to FOL Rule\n\nThe conclusion is: \"James does not have a part-time job offered by the university.\"\n\nTo convert it into FOL, we can directly translate it to: \"James is not a student who has a part-time job offered by the university.\"\n\nUsing predicates:\n*   `PartTimeJobUniversity(x)`: x has a part-time job offered by the university.\n*   `Student(x)`: x is a student.\nThe FOL expression is: ¬(PartTimeJobUniversity(james) ∧ Student(james))\n\nHowever, since `Student(x)` is not explicitly mentioned in the conclusion, we should first derive that from the premises.\n\nGiven that `Lab(x)` implies `InstructedByDavid(x)`, and `InstructedByDavid(x)` implies `DatabaseCourse(x)`, which in turn implies `FromComputerScienceDepartment(x)`, and given that `FromComputerScienceDepartment(x)` implies `Student(x)`, we can derive that `Lab(x)` implies `Student(x)`.\n\nNow we have enough information to conclude that `Student(james)` is true, and therefore we can derive the FOL expression:\n\n¬PartTimeJobUniversity(james)"

Based on the natural language text, we can define the following predicates:\n\n- Nazi(x): x is a Nazi German politician.\n- Prussian(x): x is a member of the Prussian State Parliament.\n- Reichstag(x): x is a member of the Nazi Reichstag.\n\n**Step 2: Convert Premises to FOL Expressions**\n\n### Premise 1:\n\"Heinrich Scmidt was a Nazi German politician.\"\n\nThis can be translated to: \"Heinrich Scmidt is a Nazi German politician.\"\n\nUsing the defined predicate Nazi(x), we can formulate the FOL expression:\nNazi(heinrich_scmidt)\n\n### Premise 2:\n\"Heinrich Scmidt was also a member of the Prussian State Parliament and the Nazi Reichstag.\"\n\nThis can be broken down into two separate statements:\n- \"Heinrich Scmidt is a member of the Prussian State Parliament.\"\n  Using the defined predicate Prussian(x), we can formulate the FOL expression:\n  Prussian(heinrich_scmidt)\n- \"Heinrich Scmidt is a member of the Nazi Reichstag.\"\n  Using the defined predicate Reichstag(x), we can formulate the FOL expression:\n  Reichstag(heinrich_scmidt)\n\nHowever, the problem statement does not directly translate to an FOL expression without combining the two statements. Since we need to find a connection between being a Nazi German politician, a member of the Prussian State Parliament, and the Nazi Reichstag, we'll use the conjunction operator (∧) to combine the two statements:\n(Prussian(heinrich_scmidt) ∧ Reichstag(heinrich_scmidt))\n\nBut this still lacks a link to \"Heinrich Scmidt was a Nazi German politician.\" Let's correct the formulation.\n\nUsing the defined predicate Nazi(x) and the conjunction operator (∧) we can formulate the FOL expression: \nNazi(heinrich_scmidt) ∧ (Prussian(heinrich_scmidt) ∧ Reichstag(heinrich_scmidt))\n\n### Premise 3:\nHowever, the original premise 1 and premise 2 can be combined into one statement:\n\"Heinrich Scmidt was a Nazi German politician and a member of both the Prussian State Parliament and the Nazi Reichstag.\"\n\nUsing the defined predicates and the conjunction operator (∧) we can formulate the FOL expression: \nNazi(heinrich_scmidt) ∧ (Prussian(heinrich_scmidt) ∧ Reichstag(heinrich_scmidt))\n\n### Premise 4 & 5: These two premises are unnecessary for this conversion, so we will move to the conclusion.\n\n**Step 3: Convert Conclusion to FOL Expression**\n\nThe conclusion states:\n\"Some Nazi German politician was part of both the Prussian State Parliament and the Nazi Reichstag.\"\n\nThis can be translated to: \"There exists a x such that x is a Nazi German politician and x is a member of both the Prussian State Parliament and the Nazi Reichstag.\"\n\nUsing the defined predicates and the existential quantifier (∃) we can formulate the FOL expression:\n∃x (Nazi(x) ∧ (Prussian(x) ∧ Reichstag(x)))\n\nThis is our final FOL expression for the given natural language text."

Simplify the FOL expression: (FliesTo(x, y) ∧ FliesFrom(x, y) ∧ x = y) ∨ ¬(x = y)\n\nHowever, the expression above is still not correctly translated into FOL.
