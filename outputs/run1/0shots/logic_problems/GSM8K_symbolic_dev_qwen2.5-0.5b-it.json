Finally, it constructs an equation to solve using these variables (`6` becomes `\"6\"`, since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs) in standard infix notation: `Oscar eats 2 eggs a day for 42 days and then increases it to 6 eggs a day for 68 days. How many dozens of eggs will Oscar need for 110 days? = (Eggs eaten at first period + Eggs increased by second period) / Days needed.\n```",
