To convert this into standard infix notation for representing rates and times, we need to break down each time period.\n\n  For the initial part: \"20 pop in the first 12 seconds\"\n\n    - This can be represented as 'rate * time'. Here, the rate is 20 kernels per second (the number that popped initially), and it occurs over a duration of 12 seconds.\n  \n  The next two parts were given more details about rates for each part. However since these are in standard infix notation we will keep them at their current form.\n\n- We have to calculate the final rate, which is \"4 times the initial rate\". So this can be represented as: 'initial_rate * new_initial_rate'\n\n  - Initial Rate = (20 kernels / first 12 seconds) \n    = (hiking_students + football_students)/177 \n\n  - New Initial Rate = 4 * ((total_students- hailing_students)/(next_12_seconds_rate))\n\n  The residual heat part, which represents a quarter of the number that popped in the final 12 seconds can be represented as: 'initial_kernels / new_initial_rate'.\n\n  This is because if you divide your rate by its initial value and then take half, it will give you how many kernels would have been left over.\n\n- To convert this into standard infix notation for solving equations we need to formulate the equation first. We can represent our problem as: \n    (rate1 + rate2 - final_rate) * new_final_rate = total_kernels\n\n  In terms of variables and their values:\n  \n   'keisha_popping_kernels' is represented by a variable that represents the number of kernels popping at each time period.\n\n- Now let's convert this into standard infix notation for solving equations. Here are our initial data in standard format:\n\n    - rate1: (20 / 12)\n      = hailing_students\n    - rate2: ((total_students-hailing_students) / next_12_seconds_rate)\n      = football_students\n    - new_initial_rate: 4 * total_students/177 \n        - final_final_rate : keisha_popping_kernels/(keisha_popping_kernels/new_initial_rate) \n\n- The equation to solve in standard infix notation is:\n\n   ((rate1 + rate2 - final\\_final\\_rate) / (new\\_initial\\_rate)) = 1\n\n  \nHere's how I converted this into a problem statement with variables and their values:\n\n\n{\n    \"data\": [\n        \"'hailing_students' = hailing_students\",\n        \"'football_students' = football_students',\n        \"'keisha_popping_kernels' = keisha_popping_kernels\", \n        \"'total_students' = total_students',\"  \n        \n        \"'new_initial_rate' = 4 * (total_students/177),\" \n        \n    ],\n    \"question\": \"(hailing_students + football_students - keisha_popping_kernels / new_initial_rate) = 1\"\n}\n\n###\n\nNow let's formulate the equation to solve using these variables, also in standard infix notation.\n\nHere is how I did it:\n\n\n- The problem statement has been broken down into individual parts.\n\n\n    - We know that 'keisha_popping_kernels' represents a variable representing number of kernels popping at each time period.\n      This can be represented as: (rate1 + rate2) where rate1 = 20 and rate2 is football_students.\n\n- The equation to solve in standard infix notation for our problem statement:\n    ((hailing_students+football_students)/177 - keisha_popping_kernels/new_initial_rate) = 1\n\n  \nHere's how I converted this into a solution:\n\n\n{\n   \"data\": [\n       \"'keisha_popping_kernels' = (rate1 + rate2) / new_initial_rate\",\n        \"'new_initial_rate' = hailing_students/total_students',\n       \n    ],\n    \"question\": \"(haling_students+football_students)/177 - keisha_popping_kernels/new_initial_rate)\"\n}",

She has two types of kernels that pop faster when heated up - 50 in the first 14 seconds and then three times as much, which is (3 * 4) = 12 for the next 14 seconds.\n\nAfter an additional minute where she increases popping rate by four times from its peak at this time to half again in just another two minutes: \n\n*   It takes her some amount of popcorn to eat. \nWe need a formula that gives us how many kernels are left over when Daphne finishes eating the entire pot after taking it off heat.\n\nSo, let's define our variables:\n\n-   `kernels_at_last_minute`: The number of kernels popping in 14 seconds.\n-   `(4)` : The rate at which this increased amount increases each minute.\n-   `(3 * (rate_in_first_minutes))` : This is the increase from its peak to half again.\n\nFinally, let's express these calculations using standard infix notation:\n\n```python\nfinal_14_seconds_kernels = 50 + 3*14 # Initial kernels at last minute plus three times of initial rate in first minutes.\ninitial_popcorn_rate = (4)^(14-1)\nincreased_kernels_at_last_minute = final_14_seconds_kernels * (rate_in_first_minutes)\n\nkernels_left_over_after_eating_whole_pot = 0.25*((final_19_seconds_kernels - increased_kernels_at_last_minute)/2)\n\n```\n\nAnd formulate the equation to solve using these variables, also in standard infix notation:\n\n\n```python\ntotal_popcorn_to_eat = kernels_left_over_after_eating_whole_pot + initial_popcorn_rate * (kernels_at_last_minute / 4) # Daphne eats whole pot first then half of remaining\n\n```\n\nNow let's convert this problem to the required JSON format.\n\n{\n    \"data\": [\n        '',\n        'total_popcorn_to_eat = kernels_left_over_after_eating_whole_pot + initial_popcorn_rate * (kernels_at_last_minute / 4)',\n        ''\n    ],\n    \"question\": \"(1/initial_popcorn_kernels) - ((0.25*((final_19_seconds_kernels - final_14_seconds_kernels)/2)) + rate_in_first_minutes*3^(rate_in_first_minutes-1))/initial_popcorn_rate\"\n}\n\n###\n\nThis conversion should give us a good idea of how to represent the problem in standard infix notation and formulate an equation for solving it.",

So it becomes \"(x + 12)\" in our equation.\n*   The last line, where we need to find out how much longer Arash and Arjun are late is written as an expression:\n    *   We have two variables 'total_walk_time' which takes the time they spend walking alone before getting to library. So it becomes \"max(x, x + 28 - (x + get_to_library_time))\". The \"( max( ) )\" notation means we need to find maximum value from three options.\n\nSo our equation in standard infix notation is: `(max((x), (x+28-(x+12))))`.",

We need to find out how much longer they will be late.\n* To calculate this, we first add up their walking times: 22 minutes + 13 minutes = 35 minutes\n* Then, we subtract the total time it took them to walk to both places:\n+ 91 (to get from cinema to mall)\n+ 13 (from mall to park) = \n= 104 minutes\n\nSo, they will be late by 4 more minutes. The standard infix notation for this equation is \"(total_time - time_to_cinema)\", where \"time_to_cinema\" and \"time_to_park\" represent the times taken from one place to another.\n\nNote: This conversion assumes that Sanjay walks faster than Diego during their entire trip, as there's no information suggesting otherwise.",

So, let's calculate how many pounds of puppies have spots:\n    - The total number of puppies = 975\n    - The number of puppies without spots = 170\n    - Since the remaining puppies must be spotted (the rest), we can find 'spots_pupils' by subtracting both groups from the total. However, to maintain consistency in units with inches and feet for variables like \"remoras\", let's represent this as a ratio: \n      ```python\npuppies_without_spots = 170 / 375 # there are (170/375) of puppies without spots per inch.\n```\n    - So we get the total number of spotted puppies:\n        ```python\nspots_pupils = 975 * pounds_per_foot_inch // feet_per_lump_of_spotted_puppy # The unit is unknown. We represent it in terms of inches for simplicity, but keep this as a variable for now.\n```\n    - Now we can express 'puppies' and 'spots_pupils' with the same units by converting them to pounds per foot:\n        ```python\npuppies = 975 / (spots_pupils * feet_per_lump_of_spotted_puppy) \n spots_pupils = 170/375 # convert this fraction into a variable assignment, keeping it as is for now.\n```\n- 'no_spots_jamies_dog': This involves subtraction. Let's represent the number of puppies with no spots in terms of pounds:\n```python\npuppies_without_no_spots = (spots_pupils * feet_per_lump_of_spotted_puppy) / 2 # The unit is unknown, so let’s assume it per pound.\n```\n    - Now we can express 'no_spots_jamies_dog' using the same units as puppies:\n```python\nno_spots_jamies_dogs = (puppies_without_no_spots * pounds_per_foot_inch) / 2 \n no_spots_jamesdognumspotted_pupils = no_spots_jameisdoggnumspots_pupiles # this represents the number of spotted puppies with James's dog\n```\n\n- ' spots_dog': This is a simple multiplication:\n```python\npuppies_without_spots * pounds_per_foot_inch \n```\n  - Now we can express 'spotted_dog' using the same units as puppies, assuming it per pound:\n  \n    ```python\nspots_jamesdognumspots_pupils = (no_spots_jamiesdogsnumspottedpupils / p) * pounds_per_foot_inch \n```\n\n- 'total_students': This is a simple multiplication of students by the number of puppies, keeping units consistent for simplicity:\n```python\n177*total_students # this represents total students. We don’t need to convert it.\n```\n  - Now we can express 'total_students' with variable assignments in standard infix notation as follows:\n\n    ```python \npuppies_without_no_spots = (spots_pupils * feet_per_lump_of_spotted_puppy) / 2\n no_spots_jamiesdognumspottedpupils = puppies_without_no_spotsnumpoppedups\n```\n- 'hiking_students': This involves subtraction:\n```python \ntotal_students - no_spots_jamesdagnumspots_puppies # represents the number of students with no spots.

Since we don't know how many puppies there are in total (other than the fact that Umar and Daphne have a combined population), let's denote `x` as the total number of puppies.\n  * So, `puppies_spotted = (x - y) / x`, where `y` is the number of non-spotty pups. However since we do not know how many dogs are there in this case, and only given a statement about Umar's dog having 970 puppies that include both spotted and unspoted puppies, let us set `puppies_spotted = (x - z) / x` where `z` is the number of non spotty pups.\n* Pupils with spots: Daphne has only dogs without spots. Therefore `spotted_pups_1 = 200`\n \n In order to find percentage, we need total puppies and pupils that have spots\n\n Now let us convert this equation into standard infix notation \n\n`(((x - z) / x) * (200)) / ((total_puppies - y) / total_puppies)`\n We can rewrite it as `(((x-1)*z)/x)/(y/total_puppies)`",

The data is also assumed to be in a simple format with no unnecessary whitespace.\n\nIn this case, since there's only one variable (calories_per_serving) and its assigned values for each calculation step, we can write it directly without any variables or their expressions within them.\n \n However the question asks us convert into standard infix notation. Hence I have to break down all these steps with calculations in between as per problem statement.\n\nThe formula of total calories consumed would be\ncalories = (total_servings_in_bag * 300) / bag_weight_kg - daily_calorie_target \n\nNow let's calculate it:\n\nFirstly, we need to find the value for 'bag_weight_kg'\nbag_weight_kg = total_servings_in_bag * 300 \n             = 5 * 300\n             = 1500\n\nNext, we'll substitute this value in our equation:\ncalories consumed = (total_servings_in_bag * bag_weight_kg) / calories_per_serving - daily_calorie_target \n\nNow substituting the given values for 'bag_weight_kg', 'calories_per_serving' and 'daily_calorie_target':\n \n   Calories Consumed:  (1500/275 ) - (1700 / 2360)\n   \nCalculating:\n(1500/275) = 5.45454545\nand,\n1700/2360 ≈ 7.2153913 \n\nSo the final formula is as follows:\n\nCalories consumed \n=   ((1*15*2)/6.25 ) - (7.21 / 2.36)\n=    (30 / 6.25) – (7.21 / 2.36)\n\nNow let's perform this calculation:\n((3/0.25))–(4.73 )\n=   12-4.733\n≈9.267",

If an author ordered 12 new books at these sizes and they fit into shelves that hold only standard issue size books (24-25 inch tall), how many bookshelves can be filled with the extra-sized books?\n\"\"\"\n\n------\n\n{\n    \"data\": [\n        \"book_heights = [2, *random.randint(23, 26)]\", \n        \"num_extra_sized_books = 12\"\n    ],\n    \"question\": \"(num_extra_sized_books / book_heights)\"\n}\n\n###\n\nNote: This problem can be solved by finding the total height of all extra-sized books and dividing it by their average size. We assume that the heights are evenly distributed among a set number of standard issue size books, so we don't need to calculate any additional variables.\n\nHere's another example:\n\nProblem:\n\"\"\"\nA student has 15 hours in which she can study for her math test. If each hour is spent studying on topics A and B (with no overlap), how much time will be left over after completing both tasks?\n\"\"\"\n\n------\n\n{\n    \"data\": [\n        \"study_hours = 15\", \n        \"hours_A_and_B = [3, *random.randint(4, 6)]\" # study hours for each topic\n    ],\n    \"question\": \"(max(hours_A_and_B) - sum(study_hours)) / (sum(hours_A_and_B))\"\n}\n\n###\n\nNote: This problem can be solved by finding the maximum number of hours spent on both topics and subtracting that from the total available time. We then divide this result by the sum of each topic's study times to get a measure of how much time was left over.\n\nHere's another one:\n\nProblem:\n\"\"\"\nA bakery sells 480 loaves of bread per day, with an average price of $2 for each loaf. If it takes an order processor 0.5 minutes to process each loaf and there are currently no orders in progress, what is the total number of seconds this will take?\n\"\"\"\n\n------\n\n{\n    \"data\": [\n        \"daily_bread_sales = 480\", \n        \"price_per_loaf = 2\",\n        \"processing_time_per_loaf_minutes = 0.5\"\n    ],\n    \"question\": \"(daily_bread_sales * price_per_loaf / processing_time_per_loaf)\"\n}\n\n###\n\nNote: This problem can be solved by first converting the daily bread sales to loaves, then calculating the total cost of all orders and finally dividing that result by the time taken per loaf. We convert from minutes to seconds in this case.\n\nHere's another example:\n\nProblem:\n\"\"\"\nA car travels 180 miles with an average speed of 60 mph. If it takes a mechanic 30 minutes to inspect each engine, how many engines will be inspected?\n\"\"\"\n\n------\n\n{\n    \"data\": [\n        \"total_miles = 180\", \n        \"average_speed_in_mph = 60\",\n        \"inspect_time_per_engine_minutes = 0.5\"\n    ],\n    \"question\": \"(total_miles / average_speed_in_mph) * inspect_time_per_engine_minutes\"\n}\n\n###\n\nNote: This problem can be solved by first calculating the total distance traveled and then dividing that result by the car's speed to find out how many miles are driven in one hour, which we convert back into a more usable measurement (miles per 60 minutes). We assume that each engine is inspected once during this inspection time.",

Since a fraction represents part, we convert it to an improper fraction. In this case, `(1/3)` means \"one third\" which can be converted using the division operator `/`. We calculate the amount dropped by multiplying `1/3 * 84`, and then subtract that from the initial number of marbles: `[84 - (1/3 * 84)]`.\n- `Luis_marbles`: This represents Luis's remaining marbles after dropping some, which is equivalent to `(marbles_left + num_coins)`. Since we've already calculated `num_coins` in terms of whole numbers, it can be written as `[Luis_marbles / (1/3 * 84)]`.\n- `question`: To formulate the equation for solving using standard infix notation: We have two variables left after dropping and counting coins (`marbles_left`) which is equivalent to `(Luis_marbles)`, then we multiply that by `100` percent.",

If each type of ball costs ₺6, ₺7, and ₺5 respectively, the calculation would involve multiplying these prices with the number of balls sold for each color.

We convert this into standard infix notation: `stock_price = 68`.\n- In the first year, the price increases by 75%. So we calculate it as follows:\n    - Increase in one share is `0.75 * 1` (since 100% + 25% increase)\n    - New stock price per share after one year becomes: `stock_price = 68 + (0.75*1)` or simply `(0.75)*68`\n- Then, we calculate the final value of all Ava's shares in two years:\n    - The first-year gain is calculated as above (`10 * ((0.75) * 68)`).\n    - We add this to the initial cost and subtract it from the total share price after one year.\n    - So for `final_stock_value_per_share` we get `(stock_price / (total_shares))`\n- In standard infix notation, we convert these expressions into a single formula.\n\nPlease note that there are two more steps needed: \n\n1. Calculate the initial cost of shares and total number of shares \n2. Combine all previous calculations to form final stock value per share\n3. Apply second-year decrease in price\n\nThe correct conversion is:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\nstock_price = 68 * (1 + 0.75)\nfinal_stock_value_per_share = stock_price / 10\n\ninitial_cost = 680 # initial cost of shares multiplied by number of shares \ntotal_shares = 100 \n\nfirst_year_gain = final_stock_value_per_share - ((8/2)* initial_cost)\n\nsecond_year_decrease = first_year_gain * (1-0.3)  \nfinal_answer_infix_notation = sp.simplify((10*second_year_decrease))\n\nprint(final_answer_infix_notation)\n```\n\nPlease note that the above code will calculate final stock value per share and print it in standard infix notation",

This implies that if we denote 'acceptance' or 'hired' as x, then:\n   - The number of people applying = 100\n   - One-fourth of them accept (x/4)\n   - Two-thirds of those who accepted get hired ((3x)/4)\n\nGiven these relationships and the fact that there are 25% in total who receive interviews out of all applicants:\n\n* Let x be the number of applications where an interview was scheduled.\n* Therefore, the equation for job_acceptance becomes: \n  (1/100) * (((2/5)x)/(x))\n  \nSince one-half accepts the position after getting hired:\n- Job Acceptance = ((3/4)(3x)/((2/5)x))\n\nThe problem asks how many people accept the position in total, which is equivalent to solving for x.\n\nLet's simplify this equation:\n\n* Multiply (3/4) by 1 and then divide it into 9/10:\n  (((9 / 20)) * ((6/7))) = 54/140\n\nThus, Job Acceptance ≈ 0.3842x\nwhere 'Job Acceptance' represents the number of people who accept a job position.\n\nSince we want to find how many people (denoted as x) in total are accepted:\n\n* Divide by 100: \n   x / 100 = 54/140\n\nSolving for x:\n- Simplify both sides and divide by 1.2\nx ≈ 0.3785 * 100 \n\nThe final answer to the problem is approximately equal to 37.85",
