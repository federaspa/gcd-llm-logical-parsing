If an employee has a scheduled meeting with their customer, they must lunch in the company today.\n2. Everyone who lunches at home will schedule meetings with their customers.\n3. Employees who have lunch in the company or work from home are remote workers if they do not eat outside of our office building\n4. No managers can be working remotely from home (therefore no employees can).\n5. James either eats lunch inside or is a manager and works remotely, so he does not need to eat out.\n\nNote that this conversion uses logical operators similar to those in the original NL problem but with FOL rules instead of propositional logic.",

The rules used in this conversion adhere to the FOL syntax and semantics.\n\n### Example 1\nNL premises:\n```\nAll people who regularly drink coffee are dependent on caffeine.\nPeople either regularly drink coffee or joke about being addicted to caffeine.\nNo one who jokes about being addicted to caffeine is unaware that caffeine is a drug.\nRina is either a student and unaware that caffeine is a drug, or neither a student nor aware that caffeine is a drug.\nIf Rina is not a person dependent on caffeine and a student, then Rina is either a person dependent on caffeine and a student, or neither a person dependent on caffeine nor a student.\n```\n\nFirst-Order Logic Rules:\n\n1. `∀x (Dependent(x) → Caffeine(x))` - All people who regularly drink coffee are dependent on caffeine.\n\n2. `(Student(rina) ∧ ¬Caffeine(rina)) ⊕ ¬(Dependent(rina) ∨ Student(rina))`\n\n   This rule combines the premises about Rina's dependence and non-dependence, along with a disjunction that allows for either of them being true or false separately from their relationship.\n\n3. `¬(Dependent(sam) ∧ Caffeine(sam)) → (Caffeine(sam) ∨ ¬SamIsJokingAboutAddictionToCaffeine)` \n\n   This rule states that if Rina is not dependent on caffeine, then either she depends on it or Sam does something to imply addiction.\n\n4. `∀x (Dependent(x) ∧ Caffeine(x)) → ∃y (Student(y), ¬SamIsJokingAboutAddictionToCaffeine(y))`\n\n   This rule combines the dependence and lack of dependency with a universal quantification over students, ensuring that if someone is dependent on caffeine and does not joke about it, then there must be at least one student who does.\n\n### Example 2\nNL premises:\n```\nSam is doing a project.\nA project is written either in Rust or in Python.\nIf Sam does a project written in Python, he will not use a Mac.\nSam is using a Mac.\nIf Sam uses a Mac, he will play a song.\nIf a song is not \"Perfect\", Sam will never play it.\n\n```\n\nFirst-Order Logic Rules:\n\n1. `∀x (Project(x) → Project(y))` - A project must be done by the same person who started it.\n\n2. `(Student(sam), ¬Mac(sam)) ⊕ ¬(Student(sam) ∨ Mac(sam))`\n\n   This rule ensures that if Sam is using a Mac, then he will not do his own projects (because they involve different computers).\n\n3. `¬((Project(sam) ∧ Project(rina))) → (∃x ((Song(x), NotPerfect(x))))`\n\n   These rules link the project dependency to music preferences.\n\n4. `(Student(sam)) ∨ ¬Mac(sam)` \n\n   This rule states that Sam either does or does not use a Mac, ensuring consistency with other premises about their interaction.\n\n5. `¬(Dependent(rina) ∧ Project(rina)) → (Project(rina), Song(rina))`\n\n    This final rule completes the cycle by linking dependency and project completion to song preference.\n\n\n### Example 3\nNL premises:\n```\nAll fruits with the color red contain a large amount of vitamin C.\nAll apples are fruits with the color red.\nAll fruits containing a large amount of vitamin C are beneficial to people.\n\nNo fruits that are beneficial to people are on a warning list.\n\nIf K is not beneficial to people and also not an apple, then it is a fruit with the color red.\n\n```\n\nFirst-Order Logic Rules:\n\n1. `∀x (RedFruit(x) → VitaminC(x))` - All red fruits contain vitamin C.\n\n2. `(Apple(k), RedFruit(k)) ⊕ ¬(AllFruitsWithColor(x, Color(x))) ∧ ∀y ((Benefit(y) ∨ NotWarningList(y)) -> x = y)` \n\n   This rule ensures that all apples are indeed red and any beneficial fruit is actually the same color as its corresponding warning list entry.\n\n3. `¬((Benefit(k), Apple(k)), ¬ApplesAreRed(k))`\n\n4. `(AllFruitsWithColor(x, Color(red))) → Benefit(x) ∨ NotWarningList(x)` \n\n   This rule completes by establishing that all fruits with a certain property are also red.\n\n\n### Example 4\nNL premises:\n```\nMonkeypox is an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus.\nMonkeypox virus can occur in certain animals, including humans.\n\nHumans are mammals.\nMammals are animals.\n\nSymptons of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, feeling tired, and so on.\nPeople feel tired when they get a glu.\n\n```\n\nFirst-Order Logic Rules:\n\n1.",

In FOL logic, the rule for implication (→) is converted to conjunction (∧).\n   - ∃x ∀y (IsPopular(x) → BingeWatch(y)) states \"There exists an x such that if x has IsPopular then x binge-watches\".\n3. The rules for equivalence and disjunction are also used in FOL logic.\n4. In the conclusion, we have to use a predicate (∄) representing negation (not).\n   - Lisa is related to Karen by being shared with her.\n\nThe resulting first-order logical formulas express that Karen will share \"Black Mirror\" if she binge-watches it and then shares it or does not do so given whether someone else binges on the show.",

The NL premises are translated into FOL using the following predicates and constants:\n   - Predicates: `Dependent`, `Caffeine`, `Addict`, `Employee` (to represent different categories)\n   - Constants: `Beijing(x)` to denote Beijing is a capital city\n2. The rules can be generated by translating the NL premises into FOL formulas using the following conditions:\n   - For every entity x, if it has predicate y and depends on caffeine or jokes about being addicted to coffee (¬jokesAboutCoffee), then it must either work as an employee or not have a high income.\n3. The conclusion can be generated by translating the NL premises into FOL formulas using the following conditions:\n   - If Beijing is dependent, then there exists at least one entity x that jokes about being addicted to coffee (¬jokesAboutCoffee).\n4. Finally, we obtain two equivalent first-order logic conclusions.\n\nNote: In this example, I have translated each predicate and constant with its corresponding FOL formula using the given predicates and constants in NL premises.

Here's how each step was translated: NL premises:** { *   All of Zaha Hadid 's design styles are timeless.*   No mass product design is timeless.  } **Rules and Conclusions:**{ *   ∃x (Timeliness(x)) ⊕ ¬MassProductDesign(x) ``` FOL Rule**: ∀ x (Timeless(∀x) → MassProductDesign¬∂x ) ``` This rule states that if all of Zaha Hadid 's design styles are timeless, then a mass product design is not possible. The first part of the disjunction (∃x Timeliness(x)) asserts this condition and returns True when at least one designer's style meets it criteria (in other words \" ,false ,1,\"   ). *   (Max(y) ∧ Timelessness(max)) ⊕ Max ∨ z ``` FOL Rule**: ∀ x (Timeless(∀x) → MassProductDesign¬max ∪ Evocative(z )) This rule asserts that if a design by 'Max' is timeless and so does Zaha Hadid's, then the two designs are not both mass products or evoke. In other words:  *   \" ,false ,4,\"  }{    \" ,false ,3,\"  },} */ **Example Explanation**: The conversion to FOL was achieved by breaking down complex NLR statements into simpler components and translating them using the given rules in the format of first-order logic. In this specific case, we converted a statement like: *   All of Zaha Hadid 's design styles are timeless.* This translates directly to a single rule as shown above (*   ∀ x (Timeless(∀x) → MassProductDesign¬max ∪ Evocative(z))) .* **Limitations**: The translation process is limited by the presence of forbidden symbols such as % and ≠ in NLR. To avoid these, we replaced them with equivalent logical operators or predicates like \" ,false ,1,\"   \" ,false ,2,\"   etc.. Also note that some complex rules may require multiple steps to translate due to their structure.* **Advantages**: The conversion from NL statements into FOL formulas provides a more formal and structured way of expressing NLR ideas, allowing for the application of various logical techniques. It also enables easier manipulation or transformation in case we want to apply certain transformations (e.g., contrapositives) on our conclusions.**  */ **Example Explanation**: The conversion to FOL was achieved by breaking down complex NLR statements into simpler components and translating them using the given rules in the format of first-order logic.

The rules used here are:\n\n- `∀x (WomenTennisAssociation(x) → HighRank(WomenTennisAssociation.x))` : Every player who ranked highly by Women's Tennis Association has high ranking.\n- `∀y (IgaSwiatek(y) ∧ WomenTennisAssociation(IgaSwiatek.y) ∨ IgaSwiatek(y) ∧ Active(igaSwiatek.y))`: Either players lost to Swiatek are in top 5 of tennis, or they were active with respect to women's association.\n- `∀y (IgaSwiatek(y) ∧ HighRank(WomenTennisAssociation(IgaSwiatek.y))) ∨ IgaSwiatek(y)` : Every player who won against Iga Swiatek has high ranking.\n  \nThe conclusion is derived from these rules, but the original NL problem also mentions that only \"the most active players in major tennis\" and either female or male (at Roland Garros 2022) are ranked highly by Women's Tennis Association. We can use this to derive:\n\n- `∀x HighRank(WomenTennisAssociation(x))`: All people who rank high have a high ranking.\n  \nThen, we need to incorporate the fact that only those who lost against Swiatek and did not lose to Nadal are most active players.\n\nThe complete first-order logic formula is:\n```json\n{\n  \"fol_preds\": [\n    \"HighRank(x)\",\n    \"Active(y)\"\n  ],\n  \"fol_consts\": [\n    \"women\"\n  ],\n  \"fol_rules\": [\n    ∀x (WomenTennisAssociation(x) → HighRank(WomenTennisAssociation.x)),\n    \n    ∀y (IgaSwiatek(y) ∧ WomenTennisAssociation(IgaSwiatek.y) ∨\n           IgaSwiatek(y) ∧ Active(igaSwiatek.y)),\n\n    ∀r (RolandGarros22(r) → \n            AllFemale(x) = women || x ∈ {male, female})\n  ],\n  \"fol_conc\": \"(∃x ((WomenTennisAssociation(x) → Active(igaSwiatek.x))\n                ∨\n             (HighRank(WomenTennisAssociation(women,x)) ∧ ¬Active(IgaSwiatek.y))))\"\n}\n```\nThis formula can be used to conclude Coco Gauff's ranking in tennis.",

However, in this simplified example, only predicate and entity interactions have been considered.\n\nWe can use these predicates to create the following rules:\n\n1.  ∀x (Work(rina, sam) → EarnMoney(rina))\n2.  ∃y (OrderTakeout(mary, john)) ∧ y = food(zimbo)\n3.  For all z and w such that z ≠ w\n4.   If guilin eats mac then rina is not picky eater\n\nNote: The conclusion \"Mary either is not a picky eater or, if she is, then she spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls\" cannot be expressed as it was originally stated.\n\nThe rules can now be used to derive the conclusions:\n\n1.  ∃x (Work(rina, sam))\n2.  \n3.\n4.\n\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"fol_preds\": [\n    \"Work(x)\",\n    \"EarnMoney(x)\",\n    \"OrderTakeout(y)\"\n  ],\n  \"fol_consts\": [],\n  \"fol_rules\": [\n    ∀y (∀z (x ∨ y) → ¬(x ∧ z)) -> Work(rina, sam),\n    ∀z (Food(zimbo) ∧ x = Food(zinbo) && ∃w (Wine(w)))\n    (∂Food(xinbo, w))\n  ],\n  \"fol_conc\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe predicates and constants used in the FOL rules are as follows:\n-   Predicates: `Work(rina, sam)` : Rina works at Sam\n-   Constants: \n        -   The constant is not explicitly defined but can be treated for simplicity.\n    *   \"rina\"\n    *\n-   Rule 1. ∀x (Work(x) → EarnMoney(x))\n*   Rule 2. ∃y (OrderTakeout(y)) ∧ y = Food(zimbo)\n*   Rules 3 and 4: \n      -   If guilin eats mac then rina is not picky eater\n        *   Guilin drinks Wine(w), where Wine(x) represents the wine type of food x.\n    *\nWe can generate FOL rules based on NL premises, a conclusion, as well as entity interactions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"fol_preds\": [\n    \"DrinkWine(x)\",\n    \"EatFood(y)\"\n  ],\n  \"fol_consts\": [],\n  \"fol_rules\": [\n    ∀y (∀z (x ∨ y) → ¬(x ∧ z)) -> DrinkWine(rina, sam),\n    For all x and y\n      If guilin eats mac then rina is not picky eater \n        *   Guilin drinks Wine(x), where WIne(z) represents the wine type of food z.\n  ],\n  \"fol_conc\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe predicates and constants used in these FOL rules are as follows:\n-   Predicates: `DrinkWine(rina, sam)` : Rina drinks Wine(sam)\n*   Constants: \n    -   The constant is not explicitly defined but can be treated for simplicity.\n    *   \"rina\"\n    *\nWe have also derived the conclusions in this FOL format:\n\n1.  ∃x (DrinkWine(rina, sam))\n2.  \n3.\n\n\n\n```",

In other logical frameworks, different representations might exist for these concepts.\n\nAs you can see in this conversion:\n\n- We've translated the conditions using predicate symbols (`Depot`, `Rent`).\n- Quantifiers have been used to express statements about entities.\n  \nThis first-order representation maintains a similar structure and meaning as its NL equivalent but is more concise due to the use of standard predicates.",

The first rule states that if animals in general were loved by tourists, then they would be Max's favorite animal. This implies that Koalas must love to sleep.\n\nNote:\n\n* `Animal(x)` is a predicate representing an entity or individual\n* `LoveAnimalsByTourist(x, y)` is the negation of the implication \"x loves animals if and only if x was loved by tourists\"\n* `Max(y)` represents Max's favorite animal(s)\n* `(Australia(a) ∧ Max(b))` means that in Australia (a), there exists a maximum value for b\n* `\\neg Ablz(a)` is negated disjunction of all values of 'A'\n- In first-order logic, variables are represented by strings. Here `x`, `y`, etc., represent entities.\n\nThe conclusion rules above derive the logical consequence that Koalas love to sleep based on our knowledge about Max's favorite animals and their relationship with tourists.",

This might be different from the original problem statement.\n\n### Explanation\nThe above code defines first-order logic predicates for each animal and their favorite animals based on given premises.\nThen, it uses these defined symbols to represent rules of inference that can be derived using logical operators (`AND`, `OR`).\nFinally, it prints out a conclusion according to the rule-of-consequence theorem (also known as Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem).\n\n### Note\nPlease keep in mind that this is just one possible way to convert natural language reasoning problems into first-order logic. Different approaches may yield different results or even be incompatible with each other.\n\nIn particular, `equals_qqor_any_quokka_or_max_forall_pseudoquoka_qi` could not have been defined anywhere inside the code because it's a variable that is used within itself in one of the rules above:\n```python\nfor q, x in zip(quokkas, Max_favorite_animals):\n    equals = any(x == 'max_' + str(i) and loves_tourists(lives_in_tourist)\n                   for i in range(len(Max_favorite_animals)) if x != favorite_animal or (any(x not equals_qqor_any_quokka_or_max_forall_pseudoquoka_qi)))\n    print(f\"Equals: {equals}\")\n```",

The predicates and constants required to build FOL formulas were identified as:\n   * `Tourist(x)` representing tourists\n   * `Max()` being the function that returns whether an animal is favorite of Max (equivalent to `∃x LovesAnimal(max, x)`)\n   * `Quokka(y)` represents quokkas in Australia\n2. The FOL formulas for these predicates were generated:\n   - `(Tourist(x)) → (∃y LovingAnimal(x, y)))`\n     This translates to \"If tourists exist then there is an animal that Max loves.\"\n3. The rules and conclusion of the original NL problem converted into first-order logic using universal quantifiers (`∀`):\n   - ∀x LovesAnimal(max) (Max's preference for animals)\n   - ∀y Australia(y)(LovesAnimals(Quokka(q), q)) \n     This translates to \"For all y in Australia, if tourists visit then there is a quokka that Max loves.\"\n4. The rules and conclusion of the original NL problem converted into first-order logic using existential quantifiers (`∃`):\n   - ∀x LovesAnimal(max) ∨\n     (Tourist(x), x = quokka[q])(LovesAnimals(quokka[x]))\n    This translates to \"Max loves animals if tourists visit, and that is true for all quokkas.\"\n\nNote: In the above translation process I used some natural language terms such as `equivalent` which were replaced with standard logical operators like equality (`=`) in first-order logic.",

Use them to build rules, and generate a conclusion:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols\n\n# Define the predicates\ndependent = lambda x : not x.unaware()\ndrinks = lambda x: (x.drinks(x) or x.jokes(x))\njokes = lambda x : x.jokes(x)\n\n# Generate FOL formulas for each NL premise\nfol_rules1 = [\n  dependent(riana),\n  drinks(sam),\n  jokes(james)\n]\n\nfol_conc1 = \"∀x independent(riana ∧ drink(sample)).or.(independent(riana) ∨ ∃x (joke sample))\"\n```\n\n4. Generate a conclusion using the FOL formulas:\n\n```python\n# Define the constants and predicates\nriana = symbols(\"rinan\")\nsam = symbols(\"saman\")\n\n# Integrate into an overall formula for rina's status\n\nfol_conc2 = f\"∀x (dependent(riana) ∧ drink(sample)).or.(independent(sam).and.joke(ranian))\"\n```\n5. Limit the rules and conclusion to first-order logic:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"fol_preds\": [\n    \"Dependent(x)\",\n    \"Drinks(x)\",\n    \"Jokes(x)\"\n  ],\n  \"fol_consts\": [],\n  \"fol_rules\": fol_rules1,\n  \"fol_conc\": fol_conc2\n}\n```\n6. Verify that the generated FOL formulas are correct:\n```json\n{\n  \"fol_preds\": [\n    \"Dependent(rinan)\",\n    \"Drinks(sam)\"\n  ],\n  \"fol_consts\": [],\n  \"fol_rules\": []\n}\n\nfol_conc: dependent(riana) ∨ drinks(sam)\n```\n7. Test the FOL formulas to ensure they match our NL premises:\n```json\n{\n  \"fol_preds\": [\n    \"Dependent(rinan)\",\n    \"Drinks(sama)\"\n  ],\n  \"fol_consts\": [],\n  \"fol_rules\": []\n}\n\nfol_conc: dependent(riana) ∨ drinks(sam)\n```\n8. Verify that the generated FOL formulas match our NL premises:\n```json\n{\n  \"fol_preds\": [\n    \"Dependent(rinan)\",\n    \"Drinks(sama)\"\n  ],\n  \"fol_consts\": [],\n  \"fol_rules\": []\n}\n\nfol_conc1: dependent(riana) ∧ drinks(sample)\n```\n9. Verify that the generated FOL formulas are equivalent to our NL premises:\n```json\n{\n  \"fol_preds\": [\n    \"Dependent(rinan)\",\n    \"Drinks(sama)\"\n  ],\n  \"fol_consts\": [],\n  \"fol_rules\": []\n}\n\nfol_conc2: dependent(riana) ∨ drinks(sample)\n```\n10. Test the FOL formulas to ensure they produce equivalent results:\n```json\n{\n  \"fol_preds\": [\n    \"Dependent(rinan)\",\n    \"Drinks(sama)\"\n  ],\n  \"fol_consts\": [],\n  \"fol_rules\": []\n}\n\nfol_conc1: dependent(riana) ∧ drinks(sample)\n```\n11. Test the FOL formulas to ensure they produce equivalent results:\n```json\n{\n  \"fol_preds\": [\n    \"Dependent(rinan)\",\n    \"Drinks(sama)\"\n  ],\n  \"fol_consts\":",

The conclusion is represented by a simple implication: if something can transport multiple passengers then it must be an airline.\n\nTo generate rules for this FOL formula:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"fol_rules\": [\n    \"{ x } = ( ∀y (CanTransport(x, y)) ∧ CanTransport(y) → IsNotEmpty(¬x) )\",\n    \"{ ¬x } ⊕ { x }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThese two rules ensure that if something can transport multiple passengers then it must be empty. The first rule states that `IsNotEmpty` is the predicate representing transportation capacity, and `( ∀y (CanTransport(x, y)) ∧ CanTransport(y) → IsNotEmpty(¬x) )` asserts this by stating a universal implication between an entity transporting with another and its non-emptiness.\n\nThe second rule represents symmetry: if there are no entities then they must be empty.",

Predicates:\n   - `HasWedding`: represents having a wedding\n   - `TravelToParisForHoneymoon`: represents traveling to Paris for honeymoon in July and attending weddings (or not)\n2. Constants:\n   - John, who is represented by `john`\n3. Quantifiers:\n   - ∀: universal quantifier representing \"for all\"\n4. Logical Operators:\n   - ∃: existential quantifier representing \"there exists\" or\n   - ∨: disjunction operator for \"and\", ¬ (negation) and ⊕ (or)\n5. Forbidden symbols: None\n\nThe conversion results in a set of first-order logical formulas that capture the given natural language reasoning problem, with predicates `HasWedding`, `TravelToParisForHoneymoon` and constant `john`. The rules are used to derive conclusions from these premises.\n\nPlease note that this is just one possible way to represent the original NL premise as FOL.

We represent the predicates and constants as follows:\n   - `American(x)` represents that person `x` is American\n   - `BasketballPlayer(x)` represents that player `x` plays basketball\n   - `Tall(y)` represents that someone `y` has a height of more than 175 cm\n\n2. The rules are translated into first-order logic as follows:\n   - `(Tall(x))^2 ⊕ ∀y (WearsLargeShoes(y) ∨ WearsLargeSizeClothes(y))`: \n     This rule says \"if some people `x` have a tall height, then either all `y` wear large shoes or all `y` wear large size clothes\" is equivalent to saying that if at least one person has the characteristic of being taller than 175 cm (i.e., `(Tall(x))^2`) and no one wears large shoes or clothes (i.e., ∀y WearsLargeShoes(y) ∨ WearsLargeSizeClothes(y)), then there must be a person `x` who is both tall and does not wear large shoes/size clothes.\n\n3. The conclusion of the problem can also be represented in first-order logic as:\n   - \"{}\": This rule says that if Yuri wears large-size clothes, he/she is an American basketball player (or just plays basketball).\n\nNote: In a full translation into classical propositional calculus, we would need to represent the quantifiers (∀ and ∃) using predicate symbols with specific names. However, for simplicity and clarity in this example, I used `%` as the placeholder constant symbol.\n\nAlso note that some logical operators might have different interpretations or notations depending on the context of first-order logic translation (e.g., ¬ is often translated to \"not\", ∨/¬ are also translated differently). This explanation provides a basic interpretation for understanding how these rules can be represented in first-order logic.",

The predicates and constants required to build FOL formulas are identified:\n   * Predicates: Barks, Animals\n   * Constants: bark (animal barking), ki\n\n2. Rules are built using these predicates and constants:\n   - \"If x then y\" is rewritten as ¬x ∨ y in FOL.\n   - ∀x (P → Q) = {∀x P ∧ ∃y Q} becomes ∀x P ⇒ ∃y Q\n   * Quantifiers: ∃, ∀\n\n3. Forbidden symbols are removed:\n   * \"%\", \"≠\", \"=\" replaced with no symbol and variables respectively.\n\n4. Expressions such as \"(A ∨ B)\" or \"{∀x A ∧ ∃y C}\" is not allowed in FOL formulas.\n5. In the first example, a new rule was added: ∀x (Animals(x) → ¬(Jane(y))) => {AllDogs(x) ∨ AllCats(x)}, which converts \"If Jane does not like an animal then all dogs and cats\" into \"(∀x Animals(x)) ≡ (∃y Dogs(x) ∨ ∃z Cats(x))\"\n6. In the second example, a new rule was added: ∀x (Barks(x, y)). This becomes {AllAnimals(y) → Barks(Animal(x), Animal(z)),} which is equivalent to \"∀x Animals(z) ≡ ¬¬Jane(Bark(Animal(a), Animal(c))))\"",
