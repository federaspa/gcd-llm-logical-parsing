As the pan of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 80 pop in the first 30 seconds of cooking, then 2 times that amount in the next 30 seconds. The kernels increase to 4 times the initial popping rate in the next 30 seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. After Santiago takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat.

The correct expression would be to calculate the total capacity used and subtract that from the total number of bananas, which involves finding out how many are placed first:\n```json\n{\n    \"data\": [\n        \"bananas_total = 326\",\n        \"baskets_count = 8\",\n        \"basket_capacity = 20\"\n    ],\n    \"question\": \"bananas_total - (min(banana_total, baskets_count * basket_capacity))\"\n}\n```\nThe expression `min(banana_total, baskets_count * basket_capacity)` should actually be calculating the number of bananas placed in a different way to correctly represent how many are used up before finding out which aren't placed. The correct formulation would involve integer division for filled capacity and then using modulo operation or similar logic but within the constraint not solving it directly only converting into infix notation, thus:\n```json\n{\n    \"data\": [\n        \"bananas_total = 326\",\n        \"baskets_count = 8\",\n        \"basket_capacity = 20\"\n    ],\n    \"question\": \"bananas_total - ((baskets_count * basket_capacity) if (baskets_count * basket_capacity <= bananas_total) else bananas_total)\"\n}\n```\nThis is a more precise representation of the problem's solution formulation but still adheres to not solving it directly.",
