      "reasoning": "Let's break down the conversion step by step.\n\n### Predicates\n\nTo convert the natural language problem to first-order logic, we need to define the predicates first.\n\n- Attends(x): x attends and is very engaged with school events.\n- Performs(x): x performs in school talent shows often.\n- Chaperones(x): x chaperones high school dances.\n- Student(x): x is a student who attends the school.\n- Inactive(x): x is an inactive and disinterested member of their community.\n- YoungChildOrTeenager(x): x is a young child or teenager who wishes to further their academic career and educational opportunities.\n\n### Premise 1\n\n\"If people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events.\"\n\nSteps to Convert:\n\n1. Recognize the conditional statement \"If A, then B.\"\n2. Antecedent (A):\n   - \"People perform in school talent shows often\" translates to \"For all x, x performs in school talent shows often.\"\n   - Using predicate Performs(x): x performs in school talent shows often.\n3. Consequent (B):\n   - \"they attend and are very engaged with school events\" translates to \"For all x, x attends and is very engaged with school events.\"\n   - Using predicate Attends(x): x attends and is very engaged with school events.\n4. Formulate the FOL expression:\n   - ∀x (Performs(x) → Attends(x))\n\n### Premise 2\n\n\"People either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community.\"\n\nSteps to Convert:\n\n1. Recognize the use of \"either...or...\", implying an exclusive or.\n2. Using predicates:\n   - Performs(x): x performs in school talent shows often.\n   - Inactive(x): x is an inactive and disinterested member of their community.\n3. Use the exclusive or operator (⊕):\n   - Formulate the FOL expression: ∀x (Performs(x) ⊕ Inactive(x))\n\n### Premise 3\n\n\"If people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school.\"\n\nSteps to Convert:\n\n1. Recognize the conditional statement \"If A, then B.\"\n2. Antecedent (A):\n   - \"people chaperone high school dances\" translates to \"For all x, x chaperones high school dances.\"\n   - Using predicate Chaperones(x): x chaperones high school dances.\n3. Consequent (B):\n   - \"they are not students who attend the school\" translates to \"For all x, x is not a student who attends the school.\"\n   - Using predicate Student(x): x is a student who attends the school.\n   - Apply negation to Student(x): ¬Student(x)\n4. Formulate the FOL expression:\n   - ∀x (Chaperones(x) → ¬Student(x))\n\n### Premise 4\n\n\"All people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.\"\n\nSteps to Convert:\n\n1. Recognize that this is a universal affirmative statement.\n2. Translate \"All people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances\" to \"For all x, if x is an inactive and disinterested member of their community, then x chaperones high school dances.\"\n3. Using predicates:\n   - Inactive(x): x is an inactive and disinterested member of their community.\n   - Chaperones(x): x chaperones high school dances.\n4. Formulate the FOL expression: ∀x (Inactive(x) → Chaperones(x))\n\n### Premise 5\n\n\"All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.\"\n\nSteps to Convert:\n\n1. Recognize that this is a universal affirmative statement.\n2. Translate \"All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school\" to \"For all x, if x is a young child or teenager who wishes to further their academic career and educational opportunities, then x is a student who attends the school.\"\n3. Using predicates:\n   - YoungChildOrTeenager(x): x is a young child or teenager who wishes to further their academic career and educational opportunities.\n   - Student(x): x is a student who attends the school.\n4. Formulate the FOL expression: ∀x (YoungChildOrTeenager(x) → Student(x))\n\n### Premise 6\n\n\"Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school.\"\n\nSteps to Convert:\n\n1. Recognize the structure: \"either (A and B) or neither A nor B,\" which is an exclusive or between two possibilities.\n2. First possibility:\n   - \"both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school\" translates to \"Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school.\"\n   - Using predicates:\n     - Attends(bonnie): Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events.\n     - Student(bonnie): Bonnie is a student who attends the school.\n   - Combined using conjunction: Attends(bonnie) ∧ Student(bonnie)\n3. Second possibility:\n   - \"neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school\" translates to the negation of the disjunction:\n     - ¬(Attends(bonnie) ∨ Student(bonnie))\n4.
