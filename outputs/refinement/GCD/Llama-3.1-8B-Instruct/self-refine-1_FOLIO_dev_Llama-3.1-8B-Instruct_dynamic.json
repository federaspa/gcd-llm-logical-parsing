Formulate the FOL expression: ∀x (Monkeypox(x) → (InfectiousDisease(x) ∧ CausedBy(x, MonkeypoxVirus)))\n\n**Premise 2:**\n\"Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals, including humans.\"\n\nSteps to Convert:\n1. Recognize that this is a universal affirmative statement.\n2. Translate \"Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals, including humans\" to \"For all x, if x is a monkeypox virus, then x occurs in some animal and x occurs in some human.\"\n3. Using predicates:\n   - OccursIn(x, y): x occurs in y.\n   - Human(x): x is a human.\n   - Animal(x): x is an animal.\n   - MonkeypoxVirus: monkeypox virus (we'll use a constant for it)\n4. Formulate the FOL expression: ∀x (MonkeypoxVirus(x) → ∃y (OccursIn(x, y) ∧ Animal(y)) ∧ ∃z (OccursIn(x, z) ∧ Human(z)))\n\n**Premise 3:**\n\"Humans are mammals.\"\n\nSteps to Convert:\n1. Recognize that this is a universal affirmative statement.\n2. Translate \"Humans are mammals\" to \"For all x, if x is a human, then x is a mammal.\"\n3. Using predicates:\n   - Mammal(x): x is a mammal.\n   - Human(x): x is a human.\n4. Formulate the FOL expression: ∀x (Human(x) → Mammal(x))\n\n**Premise 4:**\n\"Mammals are animals.\"\n\nSteps to Convert:\n1. Recognize that this is a universal affirmative statement.\n2. Translate \"Mammals are animals\" to \"For all x, if x is a mammal, then x is an animal.\"\n3. Using predicates:\n   - Animal(x): x is an animal.\n   - Mammal(x): x is a mammal.\n4. Formulate the FOL expression: ∀x (Mammal(x) → Animal(x))\n\n**Premise 5:**\n\"Symptons of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, feeling tired, and so on.\"\n\nSteps to Convert:\n1. Recognize that this is a universal affirmative statement.\n2. Translate \"Symptons of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, feeling tired, and so on\" to \"For all x, if x is a symptom of monkeypox, then x is fever or x is headache or x is muscle pains or x is feeling tired.\"\n3. Using predicates:\n   - Symptom(x, y): x is a symptom of y.\n   - Fever(x): x is fever.\n   - Headache(x): x is headache.\n   - MusclePains(x): x is muscle pains.\n   - FeelTired(x): x feels tired.\n   - Monkeypox: monkeypox (we'll use a constant for it)\n4. Formulate the FOL expression: ∀x (Symptom(x, Monkeypox) → (Fever(x) ∨ Headache(x) ∨ MusclePains(x) ∨ FeelTired(x)))\n\n**Premise 6:**\n\"People feel tired when they get a glu.\"\n\nSteps to Convert:\n1. Recognize that this is a universal affirmative statement.\n2. Translate \"People feel tired when they get a glu\" to \"For all x, if x gets a glu, then x feels tired.\"\n3. Using predicates:\n   - FeelTired(x): x feels tired.\n   - Glu(x): x gets a glu.\n4. Formulate the FOL expression: ∀x (Glu(x) → FeelTired(x))\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\"Symptons of Monkeypox include coughing.\"\n\nSteps to Convert:\n1. Recognize the use of \"include,\" implying a disjunction.\n2. Translate \"Symptons of Monkeypox include coughing\" to \"For all x, if x is a symptom of monkeypox, then x is coughing or x is fever or x is headache or x is muscle pains or x is feeling tired.\"\n3. Using predicates:\n   - Symptom(x, y): x is a symptom of y.\n   - Coughing(x): x is coughing.\n   - Fever(x): x is fever.\n   - Headache(x): x is headache.\n   - MusclePains(x): x is muscle pains.\n   - FeelTired(x): x feels tired.\n   - Monkeypox: monkeypox (we'll use a constant for it)\n4. Formulate the FOL expression: ∀x (Symptom(x, Monkeypox) → (Coughing(x) ∨ Fever(x) ∨ Headache(x) ∨ MusclePains(x) ∨ FeelTired(x)))\n\nNote that we've used constants for monkeypox and monkeypox virus, assuming they are specific entities. If they are not, we would need to use variables instead."
