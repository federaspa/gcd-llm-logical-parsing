Recognize the conditional statement \"If A, then B.\"\n2. Antecedent (A):\n   - \"People perform in school talent shows often\" translates to \"For all x, x performs in school talent shows often.\"\n   - Using predicate Performs(x): x performs in school talent shows often.\n3. Consequent (B):\n   - \"they attend and are very engaged with school events\" translates to \"For all x, x attends and is very engaged with school events.\"\n   - Using predicate Attends(x): x attends and is very engaged with school events.\n4. Formulate the FOL expression:\n   - ∀x (Performs(x) → Attends(x))\n\n### Premise 2\n\n\"People either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community.\"\n\nSteps to Convert:\n\n1. Recognize the use of \"either...or...\", implying an exclusive or.\n2. Using predicates:\n   - Performs(x): x performs in school talent shows often.\n   - Inactive(x): x is an inactive and disinterested member of their community.\n3. Use the exclusive or operator (⊕):\n   - Formulate the FOL expression: ∀x (Performs(x) ⊕ Inactive(x))\n\n### Premise 3\n\n\"If people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school.\"\n\nSteps to Convert:\n\n1.
