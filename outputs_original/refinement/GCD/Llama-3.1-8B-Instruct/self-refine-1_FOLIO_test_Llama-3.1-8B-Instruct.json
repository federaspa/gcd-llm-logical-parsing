However, the main problem is that the implication (x → Shape(x)) is also being nested within the predicate \"Square\", which is not allowed. \n\nWe need to change it so that \"Square\" and \"Shape\" are separate predicates, and the implication is used correctly. However, it is not clear what the implication x → Shape(x) means. \n\nGiven that a square is a type of shape, we should use an equivalence (↔) to show that if something is a square, then it is a shape. The correct structure should be: ∀x (Square(x) ↔ Shape(x))\n\nValid FOL formula: ∀x (Square(x) ↔ Shape(x))",
