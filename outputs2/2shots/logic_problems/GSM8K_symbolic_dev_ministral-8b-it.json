This is done by multiplying the total number of students by their percentage:\n```infix\n(basketball_players) = remaining_students / 100 * (total_students - remaining_students)\n```\nThe next step involves calculating `remaining_students` and then finding out how many are either debate team members or choir members, which is a combined group representing the rest of the students excluding basketball players. This can be calculated as:\n```infix\n(25 / 100 * (total_students - remaining_students))\n```\nFinally, to find out how many students in total will leave early for their respective activities, we add all these numbers together.\nThis is represented by:\n```infix\n(total_leaving_early) = basketball_players + debate_members + choir_members\n```\n\nPutting it all into infix notation gives us the final equation to solve as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"data\": [\n        \"total_students = 100\",\n        \"basketball_players_percentage = 48 / 100 * total_students\"\n    ],\n    \"question\": \"(remaining_students - basketball_players) + (debate_members + choir_members)\"\n}\n```",

The total minutes for cleaning can be calculated as:\n```\ntotal_minutes = rooms * minutes_per_room\n```\n\nThen, converting 15 hours into minutes gives us `270` minutes per day (`15 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour`). Thus the equation becomes:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"data\": [\n        \"rooms = 90\",\n        \"days_to_clean = 10\",\n        \"minutes_per_room = 10\"\n    ],\n    \"question\": \"(total_minutes / total_hours) * 100\"\n}\n```\nThis results in:\n- `total_minutes` being the product of `rooms`, and `minutes_per_room`.\n- The question to solve is then: `(90*10/270)*100`.",
