Here, we assume that \"length in yards\" is converted into feet by multiplying it with 3 since there are three feet per yard before calculating the perimeter.\nHowever, please note this might be an overly complex representation because usually when dealing with problems involving length and width where one dimension (in this case: length) is given directly while area is provided, we don't need to use such a complicated expression. A simpler way would involve first converting the known side from yards into feet then solving for other sides using the formula Area=length*width before calculating perimeter.\nFor clarity in context of requested format:\n{\n    \"data\": [\n        \"area = 930\",\n        \"length_feet = length_yards * 3\"\n    ],\n    \"question\": \"(2*(sqrt(area^2 - (4*area*((length_feet/3)*1)))+((length_feet)+(width))))\" \n}\nThis would be a more direct representation of the problem, though still somewhat complex due to need for calculating both length and width from given information.",
