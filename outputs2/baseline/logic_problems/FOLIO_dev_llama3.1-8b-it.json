      "raw": "\n\nTo solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. From the first premise: \"If people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events.\"\n\n   This means that if someone performs in school talent shows often, we can conclude two things about them:\n   - They attend school.\n   - They are very engaged with school events.\n\n2. From the second premise: \"People either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community.\"\n\n   This gives us a choice between performing in school talent shows (option 1) and being an inactive member of the community (option 2).\n\n3. The third premise states, \"If people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school.\" However this isn't relevant to Bonnie's situation.\n\n4. From the fourth premise: \"All people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.\"\n\n   This implies that if someone is an inactive member of the community (option 2), we can conclude they also chaperone high school dances.\n\n5. The fifth premise states, \"All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.\" However this isn't relevant to Bonnie's situation either.\n\n6. From the sixth premise: \"Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school.\"\n\n   This gives us two options about what we can conclude from Bonnie's situation:\n   - Option 1 (A): She both attends and is very engaged with school events.\n     Then, according to premise 2, option 3 would apply: she must perform in talent shows often (because it isn't option 4).\n   - Or\n   - Option 2 (B) Neither of the conditions from A are true.\n\nNow we can see that there is a link between Bonnie's situation and whether or not she performs in school talent shows. If option A, then she must perform in talent shows often because it isn't one of the other options for her to be engaged with events while also being an inactive member (which would make her chaperone dances). And if that is true, we can conclude:\n \n \\boxed{A}",

      "raw": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.\n\n**Step 1:** Analyze the premises and identify relevant information about Bonnie:\n\n* Premise: If people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events. (Let's call this P1)\n* Premise: People either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community. (Let's call this P2)\n* From the conclusion, we can infer that Bonnie is a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities OR she neither attends nor engages with school events.\n\n**Step 2:** Analyze the possible scenarios for Bonnie:\n\nScenario A: Bonnie performs in school talent shows often. (If P1)\nThen from P2, she either does not chaperone high school dances or is inactive and disinterested.\nBut if she is a young child/teen who wants to further her academic career, then from Premise 3 & 4, it implies that Bonnie must be an active student.\n\nScenario B: Bonnie is neither attends nor engages with school events. (If P2)\nThen from the conclusion of scenario A above we can infer this one also works out as follows:\nFrom premise 6 and 7 given in problem description \"Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school. \"\nWe can infer that Bonnie must be an inactive member of her community because from premise 4 we know if you are inactive then chaperone high-school dances.\n\nTherefore, based on these scenarios:\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{A}",
