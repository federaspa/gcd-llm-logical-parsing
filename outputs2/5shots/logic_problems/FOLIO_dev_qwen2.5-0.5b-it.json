For example:\n- If \"Picuris Mountains\" was a mountain range in New Mexico or Texas, then there would be no other options.\n- Therefore, if there were such premises, this must also hold true for Juan de Onate's visit to the Picuris Mountains.\n\nThis conversion ensures that each statement can be logically derived from the given natural language premise.",
