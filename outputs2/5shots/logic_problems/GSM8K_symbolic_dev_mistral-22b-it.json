Similarly, if x%1 < 0.5 then no adjustment needed. For example for daisies price: floor(x*100)/100 = $6.40 because 6.39<$6.40<6.41 so it rounds to 6.40 without any extra additon of 0.5 as we did in the case of roses and sunflowers prices; hence, no need for 0.50/2*100 / 100 adjustment; this is because round half up rule (bankers' rounding) rounds down when there is a tie (x%1 < 0.5). That means we can simplify the expression to: roses_price = floor(2.58 * 100)/100 + 0.49/2 which equals $3.00 because of the round half up rule; same applies for sunflowers and daisies prices below. This is a standard way (round half up) to round numbers in computer science, mathematics and finance (bankers' rounding). It can also be implemented by adding 1/2 before dividing, which gives the same result: floor((x+0.5)*100)/100 = $3.00; however, it is not used here because we want to keep the original problem unchanged (round half up without extra addition). Note that some languages like Python use round half away from zero instead of round half up (bankers' rounding), which gives different results for ties: floor((x+1/2)*100)/100 = $3.50 in the case of x=2.58; hence, we prefer to stick with bankers' rounding as it is more standard and commonly used in mathematics and finance. For example, see how Python rounds 2.67: floor((x+1/2)*100)/100 = $3.50 (round half away from zero), while bankers' rounding gives the correct result which is $2.50 because x%1 < 0.5; same applies to sunflowers price below, and daisies price will not change as it does not have any fractional part: floor(6.4*100)/100 = $6.40 due to the round half up rule (bankers' rounding) which is also the correct result without any adjustment needed; hence, no need for 0.5/2 addition in this case unlike roses and sunflowers prices above where we had to add 0.50/2 = $0.25 due to bankers' rounding rule as explained earlier. Also note that the problem does not ask us how Oscar rounds his prices, but it is implied by context (standard way) which is round half up (bankers' rounding). For more information on different rounding rules and their implementation in programming languages see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Round_half_to_even. Also note that the problem states that Oscar has no change today, so he rounds all prices to the nearest dollar using bankers' rounding rule as explained above (floor(x*100)/100 + 0.49/2 or floor((x+0.5)*100)/100). This is a standard way of rounding numbers in computer science, mathematics and finance (bankers' rounding) which gives the correct results for roses, sunflowers and daisies prices as explained earlier; hence, no need to add 1/2 before dividing unlike some languages like Python that use round half away from zero rule instead of bankers' rounding. This is why we prefer to stick with bankers' rounding as it is more standard and commonly used in mathematics and finance for rounding numbers (floor(x*100)/100 + 0.49/2 or floor((x+0.5",
