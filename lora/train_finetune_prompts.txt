<s>Given a Natural Language Statement, a Sketch First Order Logic Statement and a set of Predicates. 
The task is to rewrite the Sketch using only the provided Predicates, and fix errors if any, following the provided examples.

For fixing the formulas:
1. You SHOULD ONLY USE the predicates provided.
2. You SHOULD USE the following logical operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction),
∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation),
