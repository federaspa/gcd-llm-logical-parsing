The task is to correct a First-Order-Logic (FOL) formula containing syntax errors. 
I will provide the incorrect formula, and steps to correct it. You must propose the corrected formula. 
You MUST ONLY FOCUS on the provided incorrect formula. If more that one formula is incorrect, ignore all formulas that are not provided as incorrect. 

Here's some rules about FOL formulas:
1. Logical Operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication) ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence)
2. Quantifiers: ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential)
3. Forbidden symbols: "%", "≠", "="
4. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"
5. Expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED

Incorrect FOL formula: [[ERROR]]

Let's think step-by-step about how to fix this formula.
