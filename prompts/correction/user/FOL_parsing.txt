The task is to correct a First-Order-Logic (FOL) formula containing syntax errors. 
I will provide the incorrect formula, and steps to correct it. You must propose the corrected formula. 
You MUST ONLY FOCUS on the provided incorrect formula. If more that one formula is incorrect, ignore all formulas that are not provided as incorrect. 

For generating the FOL formulas, you must adhere to the following rules:
1. You SHOULD ONLY USE the following logical operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication) ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence)
2. You SHOULD NEVER USE the following symbols for FOL: "%", "≠"
3. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"; expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED
4. You SHOULD ONLY use the following quantifiers: ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential)
5. The quantifiers SHALL ALWAYS be ONLY at the beginning of the formula.

Incorrect FOL formula: [[ERROR]]

Let's think step-by-step about how to fix this formula:
