I will provide a set of FOL formulas, one of which contains a syntax error, which causes a FOL prover to throw an error.
Your task is to understand what the error is, and explain how to fix it. It is possible that the formula is logically sound, but it may still contain a syntax error.
You MUST ONLY FOCUS on the provided incorrect formula. If more that one formula is incorrect, ignore all formulas that are not provided as incorrect. 

Here's some rules about FOL formulas:
1. Logical Operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication) ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence)
2. Quantifiers: ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential)
3. Forbidden symbols: "%", "≠", "="
4. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"
5. Expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED

Here's an example:

FOL formulas:

"""
∀x (Eel(x) → Fish(x))
∀x (Fish(x) ≠ ¬Plant(x))
∀x (Plant(x) ∨ Animal(x))
∀x (Breathe(x) → ¬Paper(x))
∀x (Animal(Breathe(x)))
Eel(seaEel) ⊕ Plant(seaEel) → Eel(seaEel) ∨ Animal(seaEel)
Eel(seaEel)
"""

FOL solver error: "Failed to parse problem: Invalid Formula '(Animal(Breathe(x)))'"

Let's think step-by-step about how to fix this formula:

1. The current formula is incorrect because the predicate "Breathe" is nested inside another predicate.
2. We need to change it so that "Animal" and "Breathe" are separate predicates.
3. The original intent seems to be that all animals breathe.
4. We should use a universal quantifier (∀) to express this.
5. We need to use an implication (→) to show that if something is an animal, then it breathes.
6. The correct structure should be: ∀x (Animal(x) → Breathe(x))
------

Here's another example:

FOL formulas:

"""
∀x (Cat(x) → Animal(x))
∀x (Dog(x) → Animal(x))
∃x (Cat(x) ∧ Fluffy(x))
∀x (Dog(x) % Cat(x))
∀x (Animal(x) → (Mammal(x) ∨ Reptile(x)))
"""

FOL solver error: "Failed to parse problem: Invalid Formula '∀x (Dog(x) % Cat(x))'"

Let's think step-by-step about how to fix this formula:

1. The current formula is incorrect because it uses the forbidden symbol "%".
2. We need to replace this with a valid logical operator.
3. The intent seems to be that no animal can be both a dog and a cat simultaneously.
4. We can express this using negation (¬) and conjunction (∧).
5. The correct structure should be: ∀x ¬(Dog(x) ∧ Cat(x))
------

Here's another example:

FOL formulas:

"""
∀x (Human(x) → Mortal(x))
∀x (Philosopher(x) → Human(x))
Philosopher(socrates)
Human(plato) ∧ Human(aristotle) ∧ Human(socrates)
∃x (x = plato ∨ x = aristotle)
"""

FOL solver error: "Failed to parse problem: Invalid Formula '∃x (x = plato ∨ x = aristotle)'"

Let's think step-by-step about how to fix these formulas:

1. The incorrect formula uses equality and disjunction in a way that's not allowed in our FOL rules.
2. We need to rephrase it using predicates instead of equality.
3. The corrected version could be: ∃x (Philosopher(x) ∧ (Ancient(x) ∨ Greek(x)))

------
Now let's work on this one:

FOL formulas: 

Premises:
"""
[[PREMISES]]
[[CONCLUSION]]
"""

FOL solver error: "Failed to parse problem: Invalid Formula '[[ERROR]]'"

How can we fix this formula?
