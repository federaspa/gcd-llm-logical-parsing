The task is to correct a First-Order-Logic (FOL) formula containing syntax errors.

For conversion, you must adhere to the following rules:
1. You SHOULD USE the following logical operators and quantifiers: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence)
2. You SHOULD NEVER USE the following symbols for FOL: "%", "≠"
3. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"; expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED

Here's an example of how to perform the correction:

Original FOL problem: 

∀x (Eel(x) → Fish(x))
∀x (Fish(x) ≠ ¬Plant(x))
∀x (Plant(x) ∨ Animal(x))
∀x (Breathe(x) → ¬Paper(x))
∀x (Animal(Breathe(x)))
Eel(seaEel) ⊕ Plant(seaEel) → Eel(seaEel) ∨ Animal(seaEel)
Eel(seaEel)

Incorrect FOL formula: (Animal(Breathe(x)))

######

Valid FOL formula: ∀x (Animal(x) → Breathe(x))
------

Here's another example:

Original FOL problem: 

UniversalLanguage(languageA)
∀x ∀y ∃z Know(x, z ∧ Know(y, z ∧ UniversalLanguage(z) → Communicate(x, y))
Know(katya, languageA)
¬Communicate(katya, danil)

Incorrect FOL formula: ∀x ∀y ∃z Know(x, z ∧ Know(y, z ∧ UniversalLanguage(z) → Communicate(x, y))

######

Valid FOL formula: ∀x ∀y (∃z (Know(x, z) ∧ Know(y, z) ∧ UniversalLanguage(z)) → Communicate(x, y))
------

Here's a third example:

Original FOL problem: 

∃x ∃y (Fish(x) → Sting(x,y))
Fish(stonefish)
∀x (StepOn(stonefish, x) → Sting(stonefish, x))
∀x (Sting(stonefish, x) ∧ ¬Treated(x) → CauseDeath(x))
∀x Sting(stonefish, ApplyHeat(x) ∨ UseAntivenom(x) → Treated(x)

Incorrect FOL formula: ∀x Sting(stonefish, ApplyHeat(x) ∨ UseAntivenom(x) → Treated(x)

######

Valid FOL formula: ∀x (Sting(stonefish, x) ∧ (ApplyHeat(x) ∨ UseAntivenom(x)) → Treated(x))
------

Now let's work on this one:

Original FOL problem: 

[[PROBLEM]]

Incorrect FOL formula: [[ERROR]]
######

Valid FOL Statement:
