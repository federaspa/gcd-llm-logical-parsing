The task is to convert a natrual language reasoning problem into first-order logic.

For conversion, you must adhere to the following rules:
1. You SHOULD USE the following logical operators and quantifiers: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence)
2. You SHOULD NEVER USE the following symbols for FOL: "%", "≠"
3. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"; expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED

Here's an example of how to perform the conversion:

The reasoning problem is:

NL premises:
"""
All people who regularly drink coffee are dependent on caffeine. 
People either regularly drink coffee or joke about being addicted to caffeine. 
No one who jokes about being addicted to caffeine is unaware that caffeine is a drug. 
Rina is either a student and unaware that caffeine is a drug, or neither a student nor unaware that caffeine is a drug. 
If Rina is not a person dependent on caffeine and a student, then Rina is either a person dependent on caffeine and a student, or neither a person dependent on caffeine nor a student.
"""

NL conclusion:
"""
Rina is either a person who jokes about being addicted to caffeine or is unaware that caffeine is a drug.
"""

Conversion Steps from NL Premises and Conclusion to FOL Rules and Conclusion:

Predicates:
- Dependent(x): x is a person dependent on caffeine.
- Drinks(x): x regularly drinks coffee.
- Jokes(x): x jokes about being addicted to caffeine.
- Unaware(x): x is unaware that caffeine is a drug.
- Student(x): x is a student.

---

Premise 1:
"All people who regularly drink coffee are dependent on caffeine."

Steps to Convert:
1. Recognize that this is a universal affirmative statement.
2. Translate "All people who regularly drink coffee are dependent on caffeine" to "For all x, if x regularly drinks coffee, then x is dependent on caffeine."
3. Using predicates:
   - Drinks(x): x regularly drinks coffee.
   - Dependent(x): x is dependent on caffeine.
4. Formulate the FOL expression: ∀x (Drinks(x) → Dependent(x))

---

Premise 2:
"People either regularly drink coffee or joke about being addicted to caffeine."

Steps to Convert:
1. Recognize the use of "either...or...", which implies an exclusive or.
2. Translate to "For all x, x either regularly drinks coffee or jokes about being addicted to caffeine, but not both."
3. Using predicates:
   - Drinks(x): x regularly drinks coffee.
   - Jokes(x): x jokes about being addicted to caffeine.
4. Use the exclusive or operator (⊕):
   - Formulate the FOL expression: ∀x (Drinks(x) ⊕ Jokes(x))

---

Premise 3:
"No one who jokes about being addicted to caffeine is unaware that caffeine is a drug."

Steps to Convert:
1. Recognize that "No one who jokes..." translates to "For all x, if x jokes about being addicted to caffeine, then x is not unaware that caffeine is a drug."
2. "Not unaware" is equivalent to "aware," but we'll keep it in terms of Unaware(x) for consistency.
3. Using predicates:
   - Jokes(x): x jokes about being addicted to caffeine.
   - Unaware(x): x is unaware that caffeine is a drug.
4. Apply negation to Unaware(x): ¬Unaware(x)
5. Formulate the FOL expression: ∀x (Jokes(x) → ¬Unaware(x))

---

Premise 4:
"Rina is either a student and unaware that caffeine is a drug, or neither a student nor unaware that caffeine is a drug."

Steps to Convert:
1. Recognize the structure: "either (A and B) or neither A nor B," which is an exclusive or between two possibilities.
2. First possibility:
   - Student(rina): Rina is a student.
   - Unaware(rina): Rina is unaware that caffeine is a drug.
   - Combined using conjunction: Student(rina) ∧ Unaware(rina)
3. Second possibility:
   - Neither Student(rina) nor Unaware(rina) translates to the negation of the disjunction:
     - ¬(Student(rina) ∨ Unaware(rina))
4. Use the exclusive or operator (⊕) between the two possibilities.
5. Formulate the FOL expression:
   - (Student(rina) ∧ Unaware(rina)) ⊕ ¬(Student(rina) ∨ Unaware(rina))

---

Premise 5:
"If Rina is not a person dependent on caffeine and a student, then Rina is either a person dependent on caffeine and a student, or neither a person dependent on caffeine nor a student."

Steps to Convert:
1. Recognize the conditional statement "If A, then B."
2. Antecedent (A):
   - "Rina is not a person dependent on caffeine and a student."
   - Combined using conjunction and negation:
     - ¬(Dependent(rina) ∧ Student(rina))
3. Consequent (B):
   - First possibility:
     - Dependent(rina) ∧ Student(rina)
   - Second possibility:
     - Neither Dependent(rina) nor Student(rina):
       - ¬(Dependent(rina) ∨ Student(rina))
   - Combined using exclusive or (⊕):
     - (Dependent(rina) ∧ Student(rina)) ⊕ ¬(Dependent(rina) ∨ Student(rina))
4. Formulate the FOL expression:
   - ¬(Dependent(rina) ∧ Student(rina)) → (Dependent(rina) ∧ Student(rina)) ⊕ ¬(Dependent(rina) ∨ Student(rina))

---

Conclusion:
"Rina is either a person who jokes about being addicted to caffeine or is unaware that caffeine is a drug."

Steps to Convert:
1. Recognize the use of "either...or...", implying an exclusive or.
2. Using predicates:
   - Jokes(rina): Rina jokes about being addicted to caffeine.
   - Unaware(rina): Rina is unaware that caffeine is a drug.
3. Use the exclusive or operator (⊕):
   - Formulate the FOL expression: Jokes(rina) ⊕ Unaware(rina)
