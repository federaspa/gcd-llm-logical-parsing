The task is to convert a natrual language reasoning problem into a SAT problem in SMTLIB2 format, by declaring the required constructs, defining in SMTLIB2 all the constraints and options, and stating whether the correct option for that problem will yield "sat" or "unsat".
Do not attempt to solve the problem, limit yourself to converting.

Example 1:

NL problem:
"""
In a repair facility there are exactly six technicians: Stacy, Urma, Wim, Xena, Yolanda, and Zane. Each technician repairs machines of at least one of the following three types—radios, televisions, and VCRs—and no other types. The following conditions apply: Xena and exactly three other technicians repair radios. Yolanda repairs both televisions and VCRs. Stacy does not repair any type of machine that Yolanda repairs. Zane repairs more types of machines than Yolanda repairs. Wim does not repair any type of machine that Stacy repairs. Urma repairs exactly two types of machines.
"""

NL question:
"""
Which one of the following pairs of technicians could repair all and only the same types of machines as each other?
Choices:
(A) Stacy and Urma
(B) Urma and Yolanda
(C) Urma and Xena
(D) Wim and Xena
(E) Xena and Yolanda
"""

------

Declarations:

- (declare-datatypes ((Technicians 0)) (((Stacy) (Urma) (Wim) (Xena) (Yolanda) (Zane)))): There are exactly six technicians: Stacy, Urma, Wim, Xena, Yolanda, and Zane.
- (declare-datatypes ((Machines 0)) (((radios) (televisions) (VCRs)))): There are three types of machine: radios, televisions and VCRs.
- (declare-fun repairs (Technicians Machines) Bool): A technician repairs a machine.
- (define-fun to-int ((b Bool)) Int (ite b 1 0)): Helper function for counting - returns 1 if true, 0 if false.

Constraints:
- (forall ((t Technicians)) (>= (+ (to-int (repairs t radios)) (to-int (repairs t televisions)) (to-int (repairs t VCRs))) 1)): each technician repairs machines of at least one type.
- (and (repairs Xena radios) (= (+ (to-int (and (distinct Stacy Xena) (repairs Stacy radios))) (to-int (and (distinct Urma Xena) (repairs Urma radios))) (to-int (and (distinct Wim Xena) (repairs Wim radios))) (to-int (and (distinct Yolanda Xena) (repairs Yolanda radios))) (to-int (and (distinct Zane Xena) (repairs Zane radios)))) 3)): Xena and exactly three other technicians repair radios.
- (and (repairs Yolanda televisions) (repairs Yolanda VCRs)): Yolanda repairs both televisions and VCRs.
- (forall ((m Machines)) (=> (repairs Yolanda m) (not (repairs Stacy m)))): Stacy does not repair any type of machine that Yolanda repairs.
- (> (+ (to-int (repairs Zane radios)) (to-int (repairs Zane televisions)) (to-int (repairs Zane VCRs))) (+ (to-int (repairs Yolanda radios)) (to-int (repairs Yolanda televisions)) (to-int (repairs Yolanda VCRs)))): Zane repairs more types of machines than Yolanda repairs.
- (forall ((m Machines)) (=> (repairs Stacy m) (not (repairs Wim m)))): Wim does not repair any type of machine that Stacy repairs.
- (= (+ (to-int (repairs Urma radios)) (to-int (repairs Urma televisions)) (to-int (repairs Urma VCRs))) 2): Urma repairs exactly two types of machines.

Options:

- (forall ((m Machines)) (= (repairs Stacy m) (repairs Urma m))): Stacy and Urma repair all and only the same machines
- (forall ((m Machines)) (= (repairs Urma m) (repairs Yolanda m))): Urma and Yolanda repair all and only the same machines
- (forall ((m Machines)) (= (repairs Urma m) (repairs Xena m))): Urma and Xena repair all and only the same machines
- (forall ((m Machines)) (= (repairs Wim m) (repairs Xena m))): Wim and Xena repair all and only the same machines
- (forall ((m Machines)) (= (repairs Xena m) (repairs Yolanda m))): Xena and Yolanda repair all and only the same machines

Type of problem:

For this problem, the correct option will yield "sat".

Example 2:

NL problem:
"""
On Tuesday Vladimir and Wendy each eat exactly four separate meals: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a snack. The following is all that is known about what they eat during that day: At no meal does Vladimir eat the same kind of food as Wendy. Neither of them eats the same kind of food more than once during the day. For breakfast, each eats exactly one of the following: hot cakes, poached eggs, or omelet. For lunch, each eats exactly one of the following: fish, hot cakes, macaroni, or omelet. For dinner, each eats exactly one of the following: fish, hot cakes, macaroni, or omelet.

NL question:
"""
Vladimir must eat which one of the following foods?
Choices:
(A) fish
(B) hot cakes
(C) macaroni
(D) omelet
(E) poached eggs
"""

------

Declarations:

- (declare-datatypes ((People 0)) (((Vladimir) (Wendy)))): Vladimir and Wendy are people.
- (declare-datatypes ((Meals 0)) (((breakfast) (lunch) (dinner) (snack)))): There are 4 meals, breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack.
- (declare-datatypes ((Foods 0)) (((fish) (hot_cakes) (macaroni) (omelet) (poached_eggs)))): There are 5 foods, fish, hot_cakes, macaroni, omelet and poached_eggs.
- (declare-fun eats (People Meals) Foods): a person eats a food for a meal.


Constraints:

- (forall ((m Meals)) (not (= (eats Vladimir m) (eats Wendy m)))): At no meal does Vladimir eat the same kind of food as Wendy.
- (forall ((p People) (f Foods)) (<= (+ (ite (= (eats p breakfast) f) 1 0) (ite (= (eats p lunch) f) 1 0) (ite (= (eats p dinner) f) 1 0) (ite (= (eats p snack) f) 1 0)) 1)): Neither of them eats the same kind of food more than once during the day.
- (forall ((p People)) (or (= (eats p breakfast) hot_cakes) (= (eats p breakfast) poached_eggs) (= (eats p breakfast) omelet))): For breakfast, each eats exactly one of the following: hot cakes, poached eggs, or omelet.
- (forall ((p People)) (or (= (eats p lunch) fish) (= (eats p lunch) hot_cakes) (= (eats p lunch) macaroni) (= (eats p lunch) omelet))): For lunch, each eats exactly one of the following: fish, hot cakes, macaroni, or omelet.
- (forall ((p People)) (or (= (eats p dinner) fish) (= (eats p dinner) hot_cakes) (= (eats p dinner) macaroni) (= (eats p dinner) omelet))): For dinner, each eats exactly one of the following: fish, hot cakes, macaroni, or omelet.
- (forall ((p People)) (or (= (eats p snack) fish) (= (eats p snack) omelet))): For a snack, each eats exactly one of the following: fish or omelet.
- (= (eats Wendy lunch) omelet): Wendy eats an omelet for lunch.


Options:

- (not (exists ((m Meals)) (= (eats Vladimir m) fish))): Vladimir never eats fish
- (not (exists ((m Meals)) (= (eats Vladimir m) hot_cakes))): Vladimir never eats hot cakes
- (not (exists ((m Meals)) (= (eats Vladimir m) macaroni))): Vladimir never eats macaroni
- (not (exists ((m Meals)) (= (eats Vladimir m) omelet))): Vladimir never eats omelet
- (not (exists ((m Meals)) (= (eats Vladimir m) poached_eggs))): Vladimir never eats poached eggs

Type of problem:

For this problem, the correct option will yield "unsat": if Vladimir cannot never eat a food, then he must eat that food.
