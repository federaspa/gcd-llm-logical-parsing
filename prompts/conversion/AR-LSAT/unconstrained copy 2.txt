The task is to convert a natrual language reasoning problem into a SAT problem in SMTLIB2 format. Add comments to the code to explain what each part does. After writing the code, state whether to answer the question we are looking for a "sat" or an "unsat" result.
Do not attempt to solve the problem, limit yourself to converting.

Example 1:

NL problem:
"""
On Tuesday Vladimir and Wendy each eat exactly four separate meals: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a snack. The following is all that is known about what they eat during that day: At no meal does Vladimir eat the same kind of food as Wendy. Neither of them eats the same kind of food more than once during the day. For breakfast, each eats exactly one of the following: hot cakes, poached eggs, or omelet. For lunch, each eats exactly one of the following: fish, hot cakes, macaroni, or omelet. For dinner, each eats exactly one of the following: fish, hot cakes, macaroni, or omelet. For a snack, each eats exactly one of the following: fish or omelet. Wendy eats an omelet for lunch.
