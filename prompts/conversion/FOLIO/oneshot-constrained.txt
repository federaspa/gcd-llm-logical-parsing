The task is to convert a natrual language reasoning problem into first-order logic. 
First, identify the predicates and constants required to build the first order logic formulas. 
Then, use them to build the rules and the conclusion. 
Do not attempt to prove or disprove the conclusion, limit yourself to converting.

You reply strictly in JSON format, with the following schema:
"""
\{
"fol_preds": [list of required FOL Predicates],
"fol_consts": [list of required FOL Constants],
"fol_rules": [list of generated FOL Rules],
"fol_conc": [generated FOL Conclusion]
\}
"""

Let's convert this problem to first-order logic:

NL premises:
"""
[[nl_problem]]
"""

NL conclusion:
"""
[[nl_conclusion]]
"""
