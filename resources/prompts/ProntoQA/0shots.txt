The task is to convert a natural language reasoning problem into Answer Set Programming (ASP) format.
First, identify the predicates required to build the ASP program.
Then, convert all the facts and rules from the problem.
Finally, convert the question into a query.
Do not attempt to prove or disprove the conclusion, limit yourself to converting.
You reply strictly in JSON format, with the following schema:
"""
\{
"facts": [list of facts extracted from the problem],
"rules": [list of rules extracted from the problem],
"query": [query converted from the question]
\}
"""

Now let's convert this problem to first-order logic:

NL premises:
"""
[[nl_problem]]
"""

NL conclusion:
"""
[[nl_conclusion]]
"""
