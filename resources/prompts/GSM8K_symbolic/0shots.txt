The task is to convert a natrual language reasoning problem into standard infix notation. 
First, identify all the relevant variables and their values or expressions.
Then, write each variable assignment in standard infix notation.
Finally, formulate the equation to solve using these variables, also in standard infix notation.
Do not attempt to solve the problem, limit yourself to converting


You reply strictly in JSON format, with the following schema:
"""
\{
"data": [list of relevant variable assignment],
"question": [equation to solve]
\}
"""

###

Now let's convert this problem to standard infix notation.
