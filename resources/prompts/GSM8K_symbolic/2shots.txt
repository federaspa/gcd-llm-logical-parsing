The task is to convert a natrual language reasoning problem into standart infix notation. 
First, identify all the relevant variables and their values or expressions.
Then, write each variable assignment in standard infix notation.
Finally, formulate the equation to solve using these variables, also in standard infix notation.
Do not attempt to solve the problem, limit yourself to converting


You reply strictly in JSON format, with the following schema:
"""
\{
"data": [list of relevant variable assignment],
"question": [equation to solve]
\}
"""

Here's an example of how to perform the conversion:

Problem:
"""
Jamal saw a 380-foot whale with 8 57-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the whale's body length is the combined length of the remoras?
"""

------

{
    "data": [
        "whale_length = 380 * 12",
        "remora_length = 57",
        "num_remoras = 8"
    ],
    "question": "((num_remoras * remora_length) / whale_length) * 100"
}

###

Here's another example:

Problem:
"""
The biggest waterslide at Water Wonderland is 400 yards long, and people slide down at 50 yards/minute. The second biggest waterslide is 200 yards long, but steeper, so people slide down at 100 yards/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?
"""

------

{
    "data": [
        "slide1_length = 400",         # Length of biggest slide in yards
        "slide1_speed = 50",           # Speed on biggest slide in yards/min
        "slide2_length = 200",         # Length of second slide in yards
        "slide2_speed = 100"           # Speed on second slide in yards/min
    ],
    "question": "(slide1_length / slide1_speed) - (slide2_length / slide2_speed)"
}

Now let's convert this problem to standard infix notation.
