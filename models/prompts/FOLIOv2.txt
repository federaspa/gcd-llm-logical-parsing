Given a problem description and a question. The task is to parse the problem and the question into first-order logic formulars.
The grammar of the first-order logic formular is defined as follows:
1) logical conjunction of expr1 and expr2: expr1 ∧ expr2
2) logical disjunction of expr1 and expr2: expr1 ∨ expr2
3) logical exclusive disjunction of expr1 and expr2: expr1 ⊕ expr2
4) logical negation of expr1: ¬expr1
5) expr1 implies expr2: expr1 → expr2
6) expr1 if and only if expr2: expr1 ↔ expr2
7) logical universal quantification: ∀x
8) logical existential quantification: ∃x

Problem:
All people who regularly drink coffee are dependent on caffeine. People regularly drink coffee, or they don't want to be addicted to caffeine, or both. No one who doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine is unaware that caffeine is a drug. Rina is either a student who is unaware that caffeine is a drug, or she is not a student and is she aware that caffeine is a drug. Rina  is either a student who is dependent on caffeine, or she is not a student and not dependent on caffeine.
Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Rina doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine or is unaware that caffeine is a drug.
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Rina either doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine and is unaware that caffeine is a drug, or neither doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine nor is unaware that caffeine is a drug, then Rina doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine and regularly drinks coffee.
###
Predicates:
IsDependentOn(x, y) ::: x is dependent on y.
DrinkRegularly(x, y) ::: x regularly drinks y.
WantToBeAddictedTo(x, y) ::: x wants to be addicted to y.
AwareThatDrug(x, y) ::: x is aware that y is a drug.
Student(x) ::: x is a student.
Premises:
∀x (DrinkRegularly(x, coffee) → IsDependentOn(x, caffeine)) ::: All people who regularly drink coffee are dependent on caffeine.
∀x (DrinkRegularly(x, coffee)  ∨ (¬WantToBeAddictedTo(x, caffeine))) ::: People regularly drink coffee, or they don't want to be addicted to caffeine, or both.
∀x (¬WantToBeAddictedTo(x, caffeine) → ¬AwareThatDrug(x, caffeine)) ::: No one who doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine is unaware that caffeine is a drug.
¬(Student(rina) ⊕  ¬AwareThatDrug(rina, caffeine)) ::: Rina is either a student who is unaware that caffeine is a drug, or she is not a student and is she aware that caffeine is a drug.
¬(IsDependentOn(rina, caffeine) ⊕ Student(rina)) ::: Rina  is either a student who is dependent on caffeine, or she is not a student and not dependent on caffeine.
Conclusion:
¬WantToBeAddictedTo(rina, caffeine) ∨ (¬AwareThatDrug(rina, caffeine)) ::: Rina doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine or is unaware that caffeine is a drug.
(¬WantToBeAddictedToCaffeine(rina) ⊕ ¬AwareThatDrug(rina, caffeine)) → ¬(¬WantToBeAddictedTo(rina, caffeine) ∧ DrinkRegularly(rina, coffee)) ::: If Rina either doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine and is unaware that caffeine is a drug, or neither doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine nor is unaware that caffeine is a drug, then Rina doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine and regularly drinks coffee.
