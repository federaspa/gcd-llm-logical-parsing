If Nathalie is not blue, then Collier is entire.
If someone is fresh or he is not concerned, then he is not blue.
If there is someone who is both serious and fresh, then Baird is not blue.
If someone is concerned and serious, then he is entire, and vice versa.
Nathalie being not fresh and Baird being serious imply that Nathalie is blue.
If there is at least one people who is both not accurate and entire, then Collier is serious.
It can be concluded that Gabriel is concerned once knowing that Baird is not blue.
