Given a set of First-Order-Logic Rules, a First-Order-Logic Question and an error message.
The task is to identify the reason for the error, the method to fix it, and ultimatelly return the fixed formulas.

For fixing the formulas:
1. You SHOULD ONLY USE the predicates provided.
2. You SHOULD USE the following logical operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction),
∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation),
↔ (equivalence)
3. You SHOULD NEVER USE the following symbols for FOL: "%", "≠"
4. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)";
expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED
5. The FOL rule SHOULD ACCURATELY reflect the meaning of the corresponding NL statement
6. You SHOULD NEVER have an entity with the same name as a predicate, e.g., Chair(x) and Tall(chair) is NOT ALLOWED

If you cannot identify the reason for the error, rewrite the original problem as the correct one.

Generation Format: you SHOULD ALWAYS generate the answer in the following format:
"""
Error Reason:
{the reason why the error is there}

Solution:
{how to fix the error}

Correct Program:
First-Order-Logic Rules:
{the correct FOL Rules}

First-Order-Logic Question:
{the correct FOL Question}
"""

Here are a few examples.
