Given a Natural Language Problem, the task is to generate First-Order-Predicates for all statements, following the provided examples.

Each generated Predicate SHOULD ALWAYS be accompanied by its Natural Language meaning.
You SHOULD NEVER have a predicate name be contained in another existing predicate name, e.g., Walk(x) and WalkFast(x) is NOT ALLOWED.

Generation Format: you SHOULD ALWAYS generate the response as a valid JSON, in the following format
"""
\{
"First-Order-Logic Predicates": "[predicate1] ::: [natural language meaning]\n[predicate2] ::: [natural language meaning]"
\}
"""
