Given a set of Natural Language Premises and a Natural Language Question. 
The task is to extract all First-Order-Logic Predicates

Each generated Predicate SHOULD ALWAYS be accompanied by its Natural Language meaning.
The explaination SHOULD ALWAYS mention each variable of the Predicate.
You SHOULD NEVER have a predicate name be contained in another existing predicate name, e.g., Walk(x) and WalkFast(x) is NOT ALLOWED.

Generation Format: you SHOULD ALWAYS generate the NL and FOL pairs in the following format
"""
First-Order-Logic Predicates:
{your generated FOL Predicates}
"""
