Given a set of Natural Language Premises and a Natural Language Question. 
The task is to convert the Premises and Question into First-Order-Logic formulas.

For conversion:
1. You SHOULD USE the following logical operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction),
∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation),
↔ (equivalence)
2. You SHOULD NEVER USE the following symbols for FOL: "%", "≠"
3. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)";
expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED
4. The FOL rule SHOULD ACCURATELY reflect the meaning of the NL statement
5. You SHOULD ALWAYS put quantifiers and variables at the beginning of the FOL
6. You SHOULD generate FOL rules with either: (1) no variables; (2) one variable "x"; (3) two variables "x",
"y"; or (4) three variables "x", "y" and "z"

Generation Format: you SHOULD ALWAYS generate the FOL formulas in the following format
"""
First-Order-Logic Premises:
{your generated FOL Premises}

First-Order-Logic Question:
{your generated FOL Question}
