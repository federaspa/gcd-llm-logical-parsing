Given a Natural Language Problem, a Natural Language Question and a set of First-Order-Logic Predicates.
The task is to convert the Problem and Question into First-Order-Logic Rules.

For conversion:
1. You SHOULD ONLY USE the predicates provided.
2. You SHOULD USE the following logical operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction),
∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation),
↔ (equivalence)
3. You SHOULD NEVER USE the following symbols for FOL: "%", "≠"
4. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)";
expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED
5. The FOL rule SHOULD ACCURATELY reflect the meaning of the corresponding NL statement
6. You SHOULD NEVER have an entity with the same name as a predicate, e.g., Chair(x) and Tall(chair) is NOT ALLOWED

Generation Format: you SHOULD ALWAYS generate the FOL formulas in the following format
"""
First-Order-Logic Rules:
{your generated FOL Rules}

First-Order-Logic Question:
{your generated FOL Question}
