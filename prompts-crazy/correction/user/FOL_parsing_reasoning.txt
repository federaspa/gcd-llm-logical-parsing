I will provide a set of FOL formulas, one of which contains a syntax error. Your task is to understand why it's wrong, and explain how to fix it.
You MUST ONLY FOCUS on the provided incorrect formula. If more that one formula is incorrect, ignore all formulas that are not provided as incorrect. 

Here's some rules about FOL formulas:
1. Logical Operators: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication) ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence)
2. Quantifiers: ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential)
3. Forbidden symbols: "%", "≠", "="
4. The literals in FOL SHOULD ALWAYS have predicate and entities, e.g., "Rounded(x, y)" or "City(guilin)"
5. Expressions such as "y = a ∨ y = b" or "a ∧ b ∧ c" are NOT ALLOWED
6. The quantifiers SHALL ALWAYS be ONLY at the beginning of the formula.

Here's an example:

FOL formulas:

"""
∀x (Eel(x) → Fish(x))
∀x (Fish(x) ≠ ¬Plant(x))
∀x (Plant(x) ∨ Animal(x))
∀x (Breathe(x) → ¬Paper(x))
∀x (Animal(Breathe(x)))
Eel(seaEel) ⊕ Plant(seaEel) → Eel(seaEel) ∨ Animal(seaEel)
Eel(seaEel)
"""

Incorrect FOL formula: (Animal(Breathe(x)))

Let's think step-by-step about how to fix this formula:

1. The current formula is incorrect because the predicate "Breathe" is nested inside another predicate.
2. We need to change it so that "Animal" and "Breathe" are separate predicates.
3. The original intent seems to be that all animals breathe.
4. We should use a universal quantifier (∀) to express this.
5. We need to use an implication (→) to show that if something is an animal, then it breathes.
6. The correct structure should be: ∀x (Animal(x) → Breathe(x))
------

Here's another example:

Original FOL problem: 

FOL formulas:
"""
UniversalLanguage(languageA)
∀x ∀y ∃z Know(x, z ∧ Know(y, z ∧ UniversalLanguage(z) → Communicate(x, y))
Know(katya, languageA)
¬Communicate(katya, danil)
"""

Incorrect FOL formula: ∀x ∀y ∃z Know(x, z ∧ Know(y, z ∧ UniversalLanguage(z) → Communicate(x, y))

Let's think step-by-step about how to fix this formula:

1. The current formula has incorrect parentheses placement, causing logical errors.
2. We need to separate the conditions within the existential quantifier.
3. The implication should be the main logical operator, with the conditions on the left side.
4. We should group "Know(x, z)" and "Know(y, z)" as separate conjuncts.
5. "UniversalLanguage(z)" should be part of the conditions, not the conclusion.
6. The correct structure should be: ∀x ∀y (∃z (Know(x, z) ∧ Know(y, z) ∧ UniversalLanguage(z)) → Communicate(x, y))
------

Now let's work on this one:

FOL formulas: 

Premises:
"""
[[PREMISES]]
[[CONCLUSION]]
"""

Incorrect FOL formula: [[ERROR]]

How can we fix this formula?
