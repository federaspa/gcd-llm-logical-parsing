Therefore, Quincy cannot be both substantial and happy. Since Quincy is substantial, he cannot be happy. This means that the statement 'Quincy is happy' is false. Given that Quincy is not happy, Morgan must be witty because Morgan is not witty if and only if Quincy is substantial. Since Morgan is witty, and it is given that Barnaby is sudden once knowing that Morgan is not happy and Morgan is witty, we can conclude that Barnaby is sudden. If Barnaby is sudden, then Cary is not old and Barnaby is not substantial. Since Cary is not old, and someone being neither sudden nor old is equivalent to being substantial and bewildered, we can infer that Morgan is old because Morgan is not bewildered and not old implies he is not witty, which contradicts the given information that Morgan is witty.",

Additionally, 'As long as someone is not precious, he is not sparkling and not scared.' Therefore, Russell is not sparkling and not scared. Since Russell is not scared, we can use the rule 'Someone being both asleep and not drab is equivalent to being zany and scared.' Since Russell is not scared, he cannot be both asleep and not drab. Therefore, Russell is not asleep.",
