I will provide a FOL reasoning problem, an error raised by a symbolic solver when attempting to solve the problem, and a way to fix the error.
You must propose the correct formula based on the provided reasoning.
You reply strictly in JSON format, with the following schema:
"""
\{
"correct_formula": [[the proposed correct formula]]
\}
"""

Here's an example of how to perform the correction:

Incorrect FOL formula: (Animal(Breathe(x)))

The current formula is incorrect because the predicate "Breathe" is nested within the predicate "Animal", which is not allowed. We need to change it so that "Animal" and "Breathe" are separate predicates. The original intent seems to be that all animals breathe, therefore we should use a universal quantifier (∀) and an implication (→) to show that if something is an animal, then it breathes. The correct structure should be: ∀x (Animal(x) → Breathe(x))

{"correct_formula": "∀x (Animal(x) → Breathe(x))"}
------

Incorrect FOL formula: ∀x (Sting(stonefish, x) ∧ (ApplyHeat(x) ∨ UseAntivenom(x)) → Treated(x)

The current formula has inbalanced parentheses. It appears that the bracket opened after "∀x" is never closed. Therefore, we must add a closed bracket at the end of the formula.

{"correct_formula": "∀x (Sting(stonefish, x) ∧ (ApplyHeat(x) ∨ UseAntivenom(x)) → Treated(x))"}
------

Now let's work on this one:
